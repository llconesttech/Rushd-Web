[{"hadith-eng":"The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was in the form of good righteous \n(true) dreams in his sleep. He never had a dream but that it came true like bright day light. He used to \ngo in seclusion (the cave of) Hira where he used to worship(Allah Alone) continuously for many \n(days) nights. He used to take with him the journey food for that (stay) and then come back to (his \nwife) Khadija to take his food like-wise again for another period to stay, till suddenly the Truth \ndescended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him in it and asked him to \nread. The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, \"I do not know how to read.\" (The Prophet (ﷺ) added), \"The angel caught me \n(forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it anymore. He then released me and again \nasked me to read, and I replied, \"I do not know how to read,\" whereupon he caught me again and \npressed me a second time till I could not bear it anymore. He then released me and asked me again to \nread, but again I replied, \"I do not know how to read (or, what shall I read?).\" Thereupon he caught \nme for the third time and pressed me and then released me and said, \"Read: In the Name of your Lord, \nWho has created (all that exists). Has created man from a clot. Read and Your Lord is Most \nGenerous...up to..... ..that which he knew not.\" (96.15) \nThen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) returned with the Inspiration, his neck muscles twitching with terror till he \nentered upon Khadija and said, \"Cover me! Cover me!\" They covered him till his fear was over and \nthen he said, \"O Khadija, what is wrong with me?\" Then he told her everything that had happened and \nsaid, 'I fear that something may happen to me.\" Khadija said, 'Never! But have the glad tidings, for by \nAllah, Allah will never disgrace you as you keep good reactions with your Kith and kin, speak the \ntruth, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guest generously and assist the deserving, calamityafflicted \nones.\" Khadija then accompanied him to (her cousin) Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin \n`Abdul `Uzza bin Qusai. Waraqa was the son of her paternal uncle, i.e., her father's brother, who \nduring the Pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the Arabic writing and used to \nwrite of the Gospels in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost \nhis eyesight. Khadija said to him, \"O my cousin! Listen to the story of your nephew.\" Waraqa asked, \n\"O my nephew! What have you seen?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) described whatever he had seen. \nWaraqa said, \"This is the same Namus (i.e., Gabriel, the Angel who keeps the secrets) whom Allah \nhad sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn \nyou out.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, \"Will they turn me out?\" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said: \n\"Never did a man come with something similar to what you have brought but was treated with \nhostility. If I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you \nstrongly.\" But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while \nand the Prophet (ﷺ) became so sad as we have heard that he intended several times to throw himself from \nthe tops of high mountains and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself \ndown, Gabriel would appear before him and say, \"O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in \ntruth\" whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And \nwhenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as before, but \nwhen he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him and say to him what he \nhad said before. (Ibn `Abbas said regarding the meaning of: 'He it is that Cleaves the daybreak (from \nthe darkness)' (6.96) that Al-Asbah. means the light of the sun during the day and the light of the \nmoon at night).","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 6982, Book 91, Hadith 1","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What was the initial form of Divine Inspiration received by the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)?","id":"bukhari-91-1"},{"hadith-eng":"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"A good dream (that comes true) of a righteous man is one of forty-six parts of \nprophetism.\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 6983, Book 91, Hadith 2","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What is the significance of dreams in Islam, particularly those of righteous individuals?","id":"bukhari-91-2"},{"hadith-eng":"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"A true good dream is from Allah, and a bad dream is from Satan.\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 6984, Book 91, Hadith 3","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What is the origin of good dreams according to Islamic teachings?","id":"bukhari-91-3"},{"hadith-eng":"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"If anyone of you sees a dream that he likes, then it is from Allah, and he should \nthank Allah for it and narrate it to others; but if he sees something else, i.e., a dream that he dislikes, \nthen it is from Satan, and he should seek refuge with Allah from its evil, and he should not mention it \nto anybody, for it will not harm him.\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 6985, Book 91, Hadith 4","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What should a person do if they experience a dream they find pleasing?","id":"bukhari-91-4"},{"hadith-eng":"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"A good dream that comes true is from Allah, and a bad dream is from Satan, so if \nanyone of you sees a bad dream, he should seek refuge with Allah from Satan and should spit on the \nleft, for the bad dream will not harm him.\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 6986, Book 91, Hadith 5","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What is the significance of distinguishing between good and bad dreams in Islam?","id":"bukhari-91-5"},{"hadith-eng":"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"The (good) dreams of a faithful believer is a part of the forty-six parts of \nprophetism:'","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 6987, Book 91, Hadith 6","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What significance do good dreams hold in the life of a faithful believer?","id":"bukhari-91-6"},{"hadith-eng":"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"The (good) dream of a faithful believer is a part of the forty-six parts of \nprophetism.\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 6988, Book 91, Hadith 7","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What significance do good dreams hold in the life of a faithful believer?","id":"bukhari-91-7"},{"hadith-eng":"I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, \"A good dream is a part of the forty six parts of prophetism.\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 6989, Book 91, Hadith 8","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What is the significance of good dreams in relation to prophethood?","id":"bukhari-91-8"},{"hadith-eng":"I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, \"Nothing is left of the prophetism except Al-Mubashshirat.\" They \nasked, \"What are Al-Mubashshirat?\" He replied, \"The true good dreams (that conveys glad tidings).","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 6990, Book 91, Hadith 9","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What is the significance of true good dreams in Islam?","id":"bukhari-91-9"},{"hadith-eng":"Some people were shown the Night of Qadr as being in the last seven days (of the month of \nRamadan).

I set out with them and we came across a man lying down, and behold, another \nman was standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man's \nhead, injuring it. The rock rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back. By the time he \nreached the man, his head returned to the normal state.

So \nwe proceeded and came to a man lying flat on his back and another man standing over his head with \nan iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man's mouth and tear off that side \nof his face to the back (of the neck) and similarly tear his nose from front to back and his eye from \nfront to back. Then he turned to the other side of the man's face and did just as he had done with the \nother side. He hardly completed this side when the other side returned to its normal state. Then he \nreturned to it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, 'Subhan Allah! Who \nare these two persons?' They said to me, 'Proceed!' So we proceeded and came across something like a \nTannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).\" I think the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"In \nthat oven there was much noise and voices.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"We looked into it and found naked \nmen and women, and behold, a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it \nreached them, they cried loudly. \nI asked them, 'Who are these?' They said to me, 'Proceed!' And so we proceeded and came across a \nriver.\" I think he said, \".... red like blood.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"And behold, in the river there was a \nman swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold, while the \nother man was swimming, he went near him. The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the \nbank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again. He returned and every time \nthe performance was repeated. \nI asked my two companions, 'Who are these (two) persons?' They replied, 'Proceed! Proceed!' And we \nproceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance, you ever \nsaw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was kindling it and running around it. \nI asked my companions, 'Who is this (man)?' They said to me, 'Proceed! Proceed!' So we proceeded \ntill we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colors. In the midst \nof the garden there was a very tall man and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and \naround him there were children in such a large number as I have never seen. \nI said to my companions, 'Who is this?' They replied, 'Proceed! Proceed!' So we proceeded till we \ncame to a majestic huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to \nme, 'Go up' and I went up. The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and \nsilver bricks and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened \nand we entered the city and found in it, men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the \nhandsomest person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever \nseen. My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a \nriver flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. \nThose men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) \nhad disappeared and they became in the best shape.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) further added, \"My two companions \n(angels) said to me, 'This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your place.' I raised up my sight, and \nbehold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! \nMy two companions said to me, 'That (palace) is your place.' I said to them, 'May Allah bless you \nboth!

He never had a dream but that it came true like bright day light. He used to \ngo in seclusion (the cave of) Hira where he used to worship(Allah Alone) continuously for many \n(days) nights. He used to take with him the journey food for that (stay) and then come back to (his \nwife) Khadija to take his food like-wise again for another period to stay, till suddenly the Truth \ndescended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him in it and asked him to \nread. The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, \"I do not know how to read.\" (The Prophet (ﷺ) added), \"The angel caught me \n(forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it anymore. He then released me and again \nasked me to read, and I replied, \"I do not know how to read,\" whereupon he caught me again and \npressed me a second time till I could not bear it anymore. He then released me and asked me again to \nread, but again I replied, \"I do not know how to read (or, what shall I read?).\" Thereupon he caught \nme for the third time and pressed me and then released me and said, \"Read: In the Name of your Lord, \nWho has created (all that exists). Has created man from a clot. Read and Your Lord is Most \nGenerous...up to..... ..that which he knew not.\" (96.15) \nThen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) returned with the Inspiration, his neck muscles twitching with terror till he \nentered upon Khadija and said, \"Cover me! Cover me!\" They covered him till his fear was over and \nthen he said, \"O Khadija, what is wrong with me?\" Then he told her everything that had happened and \nsaid, 'I fear that something may happen to me.\" Khadija said, 'Never! But have the glad tidings, for by \nAllah, Allah will never disgrace you as you keep good reactions with your Kith and kin, speak the \ntruth, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guest generously and assist the deserving, calamityafflicted \nones.\" Khadija then accompanied him to (her cousin) Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin \n`Abdul `Uzza bin Qusai. Waraqa was the son of her paternal uncle, i.e., her father's brother, who \nduring the Pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the Arabic writing and used to \nwrite of the Gospels in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost \nhis eyesight. Khadija said to him, \"O my cousin! Listen to the story of your nephew.\" Waraqa asked, \n\"O my nephew! What have you seen?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) described whatever he had seen. \nWaraqa said, \"This is the same Namus (i.e., Gabriel, the Angel who keeps the secrets) whom Allah \nhad sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn \nyou out.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, \"Will they turn me out?\" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said: \n\"Never did a man come with something similar to what you have brought but was treated with \nhostility. If I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you \nstrongly.\" But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while \nand the Prophet (ﷺ) became so sad as we have heard that he intended several times to throw himself from \nthe tops of high mountains and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself \ndown, Gabriel would appear before him and say, \"O Muhammad!

I set out with them and we came across a man lying down, and behold, another \nman was standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man's \nhead, injuring it. The rock rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back. By the time he \nreached the man, his head returned to the normal state. The thrower then did the same as he had done \nbefore. \nI said to my two companions, 'Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?' They said, 'Proceed!' So \nwe proceeded and came to a man lying flat on his back and another man standing over his head with \nan iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man's mouth and tear off that side \nof his face to the back (of the neck) and similarly tear his nose from front to back and his eye from \nfront to back. Then he turned to the other side of the man's face and did just as he had done with the \nother side. He hardly completed this side when the other side returned to its normal state. Then he \nreturned to it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, 'Subhan Allah! Who \nare these two persons?' They said to me, 'Proceed!' So we proceeded and came across something like a \nTannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).\" I think the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"In \nthat oven there was much noise and voices.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"We looked into it and found naked \nmen and women, and behold, a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it \nreached them, they cried loudly. \nI asked them, 'Who are these?' They said to me, 'Proceed!' And so we proceeded and came across a \nriver.\" I think he said, \".... red like blood.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"And behold, in the river there was a \nman swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold, while the \nother man was swimming, he went near him. The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the \nbank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again. He returned and every time \nthe performance was repeated. \nI asked my two companions, 'Who are these (two) persons?' They replied, 'Proceed! Proceed!' And we \nproceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance, you ever \nsaw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was kindling it and running around it. \nI asked my companions, 'Who is this (man)?' They said to me, 'Proceed! Proceed!' So we proceeded \ntill we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colors. In the midst \nof the garden there was a very tall man and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and \naround him there were children in such a large number as I have never seen. \nI said to my companions, 'Who is this?' They replied, 'Proceed! Proceed!' So we proceeded till we \ncame to a majestic huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to \nme, 'Go up' and I went up. The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and \nsilver bricks and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened \nand we entered the city and found in it, men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the \nhandsomest person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever \nseen. My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a \nriver flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. \nThose men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) \nhad disappeared and they became in the best shape.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) further added, \"My two companions \n(angels) said to me, 'This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your place.' I raised up my sight, and \nbehold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! \nMy two companions said to me, 'That (palace) is your place.' I said to them, 'May Allah bless you \nboth! Let me enter it.' They replied, 'As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day). \nI said to them, 'I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?' \nThey replied, 'We will inform you: \nAs for the first man you came upon whose head was being injured with the rock, he is the symbol of \nthe one who studies the Qur'an and then neither recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting \nthe enjoined prayers. \nAs for the man you came upon whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to \nback, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so many lies that \nit spreads all over the world.

What about the children of \npagans?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, \"And also the children of pagans.\" \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"My two companions added, 'The men you saw half handsome and half ugly were \nthose persons who had mixed an act that was good with another that was bad, but Allah forgave \nthem.'\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 7047, Book 91, Hadith 61","grade":"","question #":"question #2","question":"How are the actions of lying and spreading falsehood depicted in the context of accountability and punishment?","id":"bukhari-91-124"},{"hadith-eng":"The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was in the form of good righteous \n(true) dreams in his sleep. He never had a dream but that it came true like bright day light. He used to \ngo in seclusion (the cave of) Hira where he used to worship(Allah Alone) continuously for many \n(days) nights. He used to take with him the journey food for that (stay) and then come back to (his \nwife) Khadija to take his food like-wise again for another period to stay, till suddenly the Truth \ndescended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him in it and asked him to \nread. The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, \"I do not know how to read.\" (The Prophet (ﷺ) added), \"The angel caught me \n(forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it anymore. He then released me and again \nasked me to read, and I replied, \"I do not know how to read,\" whereupon he caught me again and \npressed me a second time till I could not bear it anymore. He then released me and asked me again to \nread, but again I replied, \"I do not know how to read (or, what shall I read?).\" Thereupon he caught \nme for the third time and pressed me and then released me and said, \"Read: In the Name of your Lord, \nWho has created (all that exists). Has created man from a clot. Read and Your Lord is Most \nGenerous...up to..... ..that which he knew not.\" (96.15) \nThen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) returned with the Inspiration, his neck muscles twitching with terror till he \nentered upon Khadija and said, \"Cover me! Cover me!\" They covered him till his fear was over and \nthen he said, \"O Khadija, what is wrong with me?\" Then he told her everything that had happened and \nsaid, 'I fear that something may happen to me.\" Khadija said, 'Never! But have the glad tidings, for by \nAllah, Allah will never disgrace you as you keep good reactions with your Kith and kin, speak the \ntruth, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guest generously and assist the deserving, calamityafflicted \nones.\" Khadija then accompanied him to (her cousin) Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin \n`Abdul `Uzza bin Qusai. Waraqa was the son of her paternal uncle, i.e., her father's brother, who \nduring the Pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the Arabic writing and used to \nwrite of the Gospels in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost \nhis eyesight. Khadija said to him, \"O my cousin! Listen to the story of your nephew.\" Waraqa asked, \n\"O my nephew! What have you seen?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) described whatever he had seen. \nWaraqa said, \"This is the same Namus (i.e., Gabriel, the Angel who keeps the secrets) whom Allah \nhad sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn \nyou out.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, \"Will they turn me out?\" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said: \n\"Never did a man come with something similar to what you have brought but was treated with \nhostility. If I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you \nstrongly.\" But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while \nand the Prophet (ﷺ) became so sad as we have heard that he intended several times to throw himself from \nthe tops of high mountains and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself \ndown, Gabriel would appear before him and say, \"O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in \ntruth\" whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home.

I set out with them and we came across a man lying down, and behold, another \nman was standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man's \nhead, injuring it. The rock rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back. By the time he \nreached the man, his head returned to the normal state. The thrower then did the same as he had done \nbefore. \nI said to my two companions, 'Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?' They said, 'Proceed!' So \nwe proceeded and came to a man lying flat on his back and another man standing over his head with \nan iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man's mouth and tear off that side \nof his face to the back (of the neck) and similarly tear his nose from front to back and his eye from \nfront to back. Then he turned to the other side of the man's face and did just as he had done with the \nother side. He hardly completed this side when the other side returned to its normal state. Then he \nreturned to it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, 'Subhan Allah! Who \nare these two persons?' They said to me, 'Proceed!' So we proceeded and came across something like a \nTannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).\" I think the Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"In \nthat oven there was much noise and voices.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"We looked into it and found naked \nmen and women, and behold, a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it \nreached them, they cried loudly. \nI asked them, 'Who are these?' They said to me, 'Proceed!' And so we proceeded and came across a \nriver.\" I think he said, \".... red like blood.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"And behold, in the river there was a \nman swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold, while the \nother man was swimming, he went near him. The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the \nbank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again. He returned and every time \nthe performance was repeated. \nI asked my two companions, 'Who are these (two) persons?' They replied, 'Proceed! Proceed!' And we \nproceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance, you ever \nsaw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was kindling it and running around it. \nI asked my companions, 'Who is this (man)?' They said to me, 'Proceed! Proceed!' So we proceeded \ntill we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colors. In the midst \nof the garden there was a very tall man and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and \naround him there were children in such a large number as I have never seen. \nI said to my companions, 'Who is this?' They replied, 'Proceed! Proceed!' So we proceeded till we \ncame to a majestic huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to \nme, 'Go up' and I went up. The Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and \nsilver bricks and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened \nand we entered the city and found in it, men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the \nhandsomest person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever \nseen. My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a \nriver flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. \nThose men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) \nhad disappeared and they became in the best shape.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) further added, \"My two companions \n(angels) said to me, 'This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your place.' I raised up my sight, and \nbehold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! \nMy two companions said to me, 'That (palace) is your place.' I said to them, 'May Allah bless you \nboth! Let me enter it.' They replied, 'As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day). \nI said to them, 'I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?' \nThey replied, 'We will inform you: \nAs for the first man you came upon whose head was being injured with the rock, he is the symbol of \nthe one who studies the Qur'an and then neither recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting \nthe enjoined prayers. \nAs for the man you came upon whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to \nback, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so many lies that \nit spreads all over the world. And those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction \nresembling an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses. \nAnd the man whom you saw swimming in the river and given a stone to swallow, is the eater of usury \n(Riba). \nAnd the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going round it, is Malik, the \ngatekeeper of Hell. \nAnd the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is Abraham and the children around him are those \nchildren who die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic Faith). \nThe narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! What about the children of \npagans?\" The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, \"And also the children of pagans.\" \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) added, \"My two companions added, 'The men you saw half handsome and half ugly were \nthose persons who had mixed an act that was good with another that was bad, but Allah forgave \nthem.'\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 7047, Book 91, Hadith 61","grade":"","question #":"question #3","question":"What is the significance of the imagery of a river and transformation in the context of redemption and forgiveness?","id":"bukhari-91-187"}]
