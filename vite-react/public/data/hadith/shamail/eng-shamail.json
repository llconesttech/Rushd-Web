His hair was neither crisply curled nor lank; it was loosely curled. He was neither plump nor chubby-cheeked, and in his face there was a rounded quality. He was white with a reddish tinge, dark black-eyed, with long eyelashes. He had splendid kneecaps, elbow joints and shoulder blades, free from hair. He had a strip of hair from the top of the chest to the navel. The palms of his hands and the soles of his feet were thickset. When he walked, he moved as if he were descending a declivity, and when he looked around, he looked around altogether. Between his shoulders was the Seal of Prophethood, for he is the Seal of the Prophets. He was the best of the people in generosity, the most truthful of the people in speech, the gentlest of them in temperament, and the noblest of them in social intercourse. If someone saw him unexpectedly, he was awestruck by him, and if someone came to know him, he loved him. His describer says: “I have never seen the like of him (Allah bless him and give him peace), neither before him nor after him.”"

He was taller than medium-sized, and shorter than the slender giant. His head was grand and impressive, with loosely curled hair. If his forelock became divided, he would part it. Otherwise his hair would not cross over his earlobes, and he would let it grow plentiful and long. He was bright of color, broad of forehead, endowed with arched eyebrows, perfect without being conjoined, with a vein between them that anger would cause to pulsate. The bridge of his nose was curved. He had a light that would rise over him, and someone who did not reflect on him would consider him haughty. He was thickly bearded, endowed with smooth cheeks, a wide mouth, cleft teeth, and a delicate strip of hair from the top of the chest to the navel. It was as if his neck were the neck of a statue shaped in pure silver. He was well proportioned in physique, firmly cohesive, with the stomach and the breast in even balance. He was wide-chested, broad-shouldered, endowed with stout limbs and very shiny bare skin. Between the top of the chest and the navel by a strip of hair like a line of writing, while his breasts and stomach were bare apart from that. He had hair on his arms and shoulders and the upper parts of his chest. His forearms were long. He had a sensitive touch of the hand. The palms of his hands and the soles of his feet were thickset. His extremities were well formed [sa’il (or he may have said sha’il)]. The hollows of his soles were very deep-set. His feet were so smooth that water bounced off them. When he left a place, he would go away striding decisively. He would tread inclining forward and walk comfortably. His gait was brisk. When he walked, it was as if he were descending a declivity, and when he looked around, he looked around altogether. He lowered his eyesight, and he spent more time looking at the ground than he did looking at the sky. The majority of his looking was observation. He would urge his Companions to proceed ahead of him, and he would be the first to greet anyone he encountered with the salutation of peace.”"

He would not speak unnecessarily. He would introduce and conclude his speech with: 'Bismillahi ta'ala [In the Name of Allah, Exalted is He]!' He would speak using simple words bearing many profound meanings [bi-jawami'i ’l-kalim]. His speech was concise, neither excessive nor abridged. It was neither uncouth nor contemptible. He would extol a blessing, however small, and he would not find fault with any aspect of it. He neither condemned nor praised those who enjoyed food and drink, and he would not be angered by this world. If the truth were overstepped, he would be so furious that he could do nothing but right the wrong. He would not be angry for his own sake or come to his own defense. When he beckoned, he beckoned with the whole of the palm of his hand, and when he was astonished, he turned it over, and when he spoke, he gestured with his hands, and placed his right palm over the base of his left thumb. When he was angry, he turned away and averted his face, and when he was happy, he lowered his gaze. Most of his laughter was in the form of a smile that revealed teeth as white as hailstones'.”"

If I mention him, I shall mention his apparent faults ['ujara-hu] and his hidden defects [bujara-hu]”\n‘The third said: “My husband is extremely tall and ill- natured ['ashannaq].

If he lies down to sleep, he wraps himself up [iltaffa], and he does not feel with the palm of his hand to detect [his wife’s] sorrow [al-baththa].”\n‘The seventh said: “My husband is incompetent ['ayaya’]— or dispirited [ghayaya’]—, impotent [tabaqa], sick with\nevery sickness [da’].

Malik is better than that. [In order to provide food for the guest], he has camels with many stalls [mabarik] and few pastures. If they hear the sound of the lute, they know for certain that they are about to be slaughtered [hawalik]”\n‘The eleventh said: “My husband is Abu Zar\", and what about Abu Zar'? He has made my ears dangle with jewelry. He has filled my upper arms with fat. He has made me happy, so my soul has become happy with me. He found me among the owners of little sheep and goats, in dire straits, so he put me among the owners of neighing [horses], braying [camels], crop-treading [cows] and fattening [sheep]. I therefore speak in his presence, for I shall not be rebuked. I sleep soundly until the morning arrives, and I shall drink until I satisfy my thirst.\n“The mother of Abu Zar so what about the mother of Abu Zar? Her bundles [of clothes and suchlike] are heavy, and her house is spacious.\n“The son of Abu Zar so what about the son of Abu Zar? His couch is like a palm-stick stripped of its leaves [because he is very slender], and the foreleg of the lamb fills his stomach.\n“The daughter of Abu Zar, so what about the daughter of Abu Zar? She is obedient to her father and obedient to her mother. She fits perfectly into her clothes, and she is the rage of her female neighbor.\n“The maidservant of Abu Zar so what about the maidservant of Abu Zar? She does not broadcast our speech, nor does she scatter our provisions, nor does she fill our home with treachery and slander.”\n‘She said: “Abu Zar\" went out while the milkskins were being churned, and so he encountered a woman accompanied by two children of hers. Like a pair of lynxes, they were playing below her waist with a couple of lumps shaped like pomegranates. He therefore divorced me and married her, so I married a nobly generous man. He rode a sturdy horse and held a spear. He endowed me with rich benefits, and gave me a couple of every perfume. He said: ‘Eat, Umm Zar, and feed your relatives!’ Yet even if I collected everything that he gave me, it would not amount to the smallest of the vessels of Abu Zar'!”\n'A'isha said (may Allah be well pleased with her): “Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace) said to me: ‘I have been to you as Abu Zar was to Umm Zar'.”"

Wa in tagh-fir lahum fa-innaka antal azizul hakim.\nTranslation: \"If Thou punish them, lo! they are Thy slaves, and if Thou forgive them, (lo! the are Thy slaves).Lo! Thou, only Thou, art Mighty, the wise\".Surah Maa-idah, 118.\nThe Being that possesses great power, if He wills, He may forgive the criminal. The One that is all Wise, there is Wisdom and benefit in every act of His. The reason for Sayyidina Rasulullah Sallallahu 'Alayhi Wasallam reciting this aayah while standing and also in the ruku and sajdah, and repeating it many times, is to bring to mind the two attributes of Allah, namely the attributes of justice and forgiveness. The whole scene on the day of qiyaamah will be of these two things. It is stated that Imaam Aa'zam Abu Hanifah RA. also recited the following aayah the whole night:\nWamtaazul yauma ayyuhal mujrimun.\nTranslation: \"But avaunt ye, O ye guilty, this day!\" Surah Yaseen, 58.\nIn this aayah too the scene of qiyaamah is portrayed. That today the sinners should separate and distinguish themselves. What a severe and nerve-chilling command this is. Today they are together with the pious and holy people and benefiting from the barakaat (blessings) they receive, but at this moment the sinners will be separated from them. May the Most Merciful Allah with His Grace keep those pious souls under His shadow, otherwise it is really a time for great trials."

Then he bowed down and remained bowing for as long as he had remained standing upright, saying: “Glory be to the Lord of power [jabarut], sovereignty [malakut], magnificence [kibriya'] and sublimity ['azama]!” Then he prostrated for as long as he had bowed, saying: ““Glory be to the Lord of power, sovereignty, magnificence and sublimity!” Then he recited the Sura of the Family of 'Imran [Al 'Imran] followed by another Sura, and he did this in every cycle of the ritual prayer.”"

Then he divided his section between himself and the people, so he was assigning that in particular to the common folk, and he was not keeping anything from them. His conduct in the section of the Community included preference for the people of excellent merit, with his permission, and its allotment according to the value of their excellent merit in the religion, for among them was the one burdened with one need, and among them was the one burdened with two needs, and among them was the one burdened with multiple needs. He would therefore preoccupy himself with them, and preoccupy them with what would benefit them and the Community, including questioning them about it and informing them of what would be appropriate for them. He would say: 'Let the one of you who is present inform the absentee, and notify me of the need of someone who is incapable of notification, for if someone notifies a Sultan of the need of someone who is incapable of its notification, Allah will establish his feet firmly on the Day of the Resurrection. Nothing but that will be mentioned in His presence, and it will not be accepted from anyone other than him. They will enter as seekers, and they will not separate except on the strength of an intuition, and they will emerge as guides (meaning to goodness).’”\nHe said: “Then I asked him about his exit: ‘How was he used to behaving in it?’ He said: ‘Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace) used to hold his tongue with regard to anything that did not concern him. He used to bring people together and not alienate them. He would honor the noble, generous man of every community, and put him in charge of them. He would caution people and be wary of them, without concealing his good humor and his natural disposition from anyone among them. He would watch out for his Companions, and he would ask people about their affairs. He would present the beautiful in a favorable light and strengthen it, and he would reveal the ugly for what it was and weaken it. He was equitable, not argumentative. He remained vigilant lest others be negligent or deviate from the right path. He had a means of dealing with every situation. He would neither fall short of the truth, nor overstep it. Those who followed him were the best of people. The most meritorious in his sight were those most receptive to sincere advice and most elevated in status those most generous in consolation and support.’”\nHe said: “Then I asked him about his session, so he said: ‘Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace) would neither stand up nor sit down without observing the remembrance of Allah. When he eventually joined a group of people, he would take whatever seat was available, and he instructed others to do the same. He would give each of his sitting companions his share of time and attention, and every one of them would feel equally honored. If someone sat with him, or conferred with him about a need, he would bear with him patiently, so that the person who had sought him out would be the first to leave. If someone asked him for something he needed, he would not send him away without what he had requested, or least some comforting words. His munificence and his good nature encompassed people such that he became a father to them, and they became truly equal in his presence. His session was a session of knowledge, forbearance, modesty, trust and patience. Voices were not raised there, there was no talk of women, and people’s lapses were not broadcast. They were on a par with one another, contending with each other only in piety, humbly revering the elderly and showing compassion for the young. They were solicitous to the needy, and took good care of the stranger.’”"

He would take no interest in what he did not desire, he would not leave anyone who pleaded with him hopeless or disappointed. There were three things he avoided: hypocrisy, excess, and what did not concern him. Similarly, he would not blame someone, find fault with him, or invade his privacy. He would only utter that for which he hoped to earn a reward. When he spoke, his table companions bowed in silence as if birds had alighted on their heads, and only when he fell silent would they speak. They would not contest one another’s right to speak in his presence, and when someone spoke in his presence, they listened to him until he finished. Their speech in his presence was the speech of the best of them. He would laugh about whatever they laughed about, and marvel at whatever they marveled at. He used to exercise patience with a stranger's rough manner of speaking or making inquiries, even if his Companions were keen to attract them, saying: ‘If you find someone seeking something he needs, you must help him!’ He would only accept praise in moderation, and he would not interrupt someone who was speaking, until he transgressed a limit, in which case he would interrupt him with a prohibition or by standing up.”"

They therefore asked his wife: “Where is your mate?” She said: “He has gone to draw sweet water for us.” They did not have to wait long before Abu’l-Haitham brought a waterskin that he was carrying full, so he set it down, and came to embrace the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace), offering his father and his mother as ransom for him. Then he took them to his garden, and spread a carpet for them. Then he went to a date palm, brought a bunch of dates and set it down. The Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “Have you not selected for us some of its ripe dates?” He replied: “O Messenger of Allah, I intended to let you choose or prefer some of its ripe and its unripe dates,” so they ate dates and drank from that water. Then the Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “By the One in whose Hand is my soul, this is some of the gracious favor about which you shall be asked on the Day of Resurrection: cool shade, good dates and cold water!” Then Abu’l-Haitham went to make a meal for them, so the Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “Do not slaughter a milch-animal for us.” He therefore slaughtered a young she-goat or a young billy goat, and brought it to them, so they ate. The Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “Do you have a servant?” When the answer was “No,” he said: “If a prisoner of war comes to us, come to us!” Then he (Allah bless him and give him peace) was brought two captives, unaccompanied by a third. Abu’l-Haitham then came to him, and the Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “Choose from the pair of them,” so he said: “O Messenger of Allah, choose for me!” The Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “The person whose opinion is requested deserves to be trusted. Take this one, for I have seen him performing the ritual prayer, and expect well of him!” Abu l-Haitham then went to his wife and told her what Allah’s Messenger had said, so his wife said: “You cannot arrive at the truth of what the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) said about him, except by setting him free!” He said: “He is free, then!” The Prophet said (Allah bless him and give him peace): “Allah has not sent any Prophet, nor any Caliph, without his having two intimate friends: one who commands him to do what is right and fair, and forbids him to do what is wrong and unfair, and one who will spare no effort to corrupt him. If one is wary of the evil companion, he will be preserved from harm.”"

      "text": "Salim ibn 'Ubaida said:\n“Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace) lost consciousness in his illness, then he regained consciousness and said: ‘Has the ritual prayer arrived?’ They said: ‘Yes,’ so he said: ‘Command Bilal to give the call to prayer, and command Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.’ Then he lost consciousness, and when he recovered, he said: ‘Has the ritual prayer arrived?’ They said: ‘Yes,’ so he said: ‘Command Bilal to give the call to prayer, and command Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer.’ 'A'isha then said: ‘My father is a melancholy man. If he is given that responsibility, he will weep and lose command of himself. SO if only you would appoint someone else!'\nHe [Salim] said: “Then he lost consciousness and recovered, so he said: ‘Command Bilal to give the call to prayer, and command Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer, for you are the female companions of Yusuf!’ Bilal was therefore commanded, so he gave the call to prayer, and Abu Bakr was commanded, so he led the people in prayer. Then Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace) felt light in the head, so he said: ‘Find me someone I can lean on!’ Barira and another man therefore came to him, so he leaned on them. When Abu Bakr saw him, the man was about to withdraw, but he signaled for him to stay in his place until Abu Bakr completed his ritual prayer. Then Allah’s Messenger died (Allah bless him and give him peace), so 'Umar said: ‘If I hear anyone mention that Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace) has died, I will strike him with this sword of mine!”’\nHe [Salim] said: “The people were unlettered folk among whom there had never come a prophet before, so they held their tongues. But then they said: ‘O Salim, go to the Companion of Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace) and summon him.’ So I went to see Abu Bakr, in the mosque. I came to him weeping and perplexed, so when he saw me, he said: ‘Has Allah’s Messenger died (Allah bless him and give him peace)?’ I replied: 'Umar says: “If anyone mentions that Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace) has died, I will strike him with this sword of mine!” He then said to me: ‘Go outside,’ so I went outside with him. Then he came and found the people in the presence of Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace).\n“He therefore said: ‘O people, get out of my way,’ so they got out of his way. Then he leaned over him and touched him, saying: “You will surely die, and they will surely die.\" [inna-ka mayyitun wa inna-hum mayyitun].” (Al-Qur'an.39:3O). Then they said: ‘O Companion of Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace), should the funeral prayer be performed for Allah’s Messenger?’ When he said: ‘Yes,’ they asked: And how?’ He said: A group will enter, proclaim the Supreme Greatness of Allah, perform the ritual prayer and offer supplication. Then they will go out, so that other people may enter.’ They said: ‘O Companion of Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace), should Allah’s Messenger (Allah bless him and give him peace) be buried?’ When he said: ‘Yes,’ they asked: ‘Where?’ He said: ‘In the place in which Allah took his spirit, for Allah would not take his spirit in a place that was not good,’ and they knew that he had spoken the truth.’ Then he gave instructions for the sons of his father to bathe him, and the Emigrants [al-Muhajirun] assembled, consulting with one another. They said: ‘Take us to our brethren among the Helpers [al-Ansar], so that we may include them with us in this business.' The Helpers then said: ‘There should be a commander among us and a commander among you,’ so 'Umar ibn al-Khattab said: ‘Who has the like of these three [excellent merits of Abu Bakr]? [In the words of the Qur’an]: “The second of the two; when the two of them were in the cave, when he said to his companion: ‘Do not grieve. Allah is with us [thaniya’thnaini idh huma fi’l-ghari idh yaqulu li-sahibi-hi la tahzan inna’llaha ma'a-na].’” (Al-Qur'an.9:4O). Who are the two of them?’ Then he extended his hand, so they pledged allegiance to him, and the people paid him a beautiful homage.”"
