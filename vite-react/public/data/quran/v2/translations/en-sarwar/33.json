God tells the Truth and shows the right path"},{"number":5,"text":"Call them sons of their own fathers. It is more just in the eyes of God. If you do not know their fathers, they are your brothers and friends in religion. You will not be responsible for your mistakes, but you will be responsible for what you do intentionally. God is All-forgiving and All-merciful"},{"number":6,"text":"The Prophet has more authority over the believers than themselves. His wives are their mothers. The relatives are closer to each other, according to the Book of God, than the believers and the emigrants. However, you may show kindness to your guardians.

The promise of God and His Messenger is true.\" This only strengthens their faith and their desire of submission to the will of God"},{"number":23,"text":"Among the believers there are people who are true in their promise to God. Some of them have already passed away and some of them are waiting.

God is All-forgiving and All-merciful"},{"number":25,"text":"God repelled the unbelievers in their rage. They could not achieve anything good. God rendered sufficient support to the believers in fighting.

You hide within yourself what God wants to make public. You are afraid of people while it is God whom one should fear.\" When Zayd set her free, We gave her in marriage to you so that the believers would not face difficulties about the wives of their adopted sons when they are divorced.

When you have finished eating, leave his home. Do not sit around chatting among yourselves. This will annoy the Prophet but he will feel embarrassed to tell you. God does not feel embarrassed to tell you the truth. When you want to ask something from the wives of the Prophet, ask them from behind the curtain. This would be more proper for you and for them.
