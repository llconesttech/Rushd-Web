When the amount of camels is between twenty -five to thirty- five, the due Zakah is one she-camel ‘bint makhad’ (a camel which is one year old and just starting the second year) or a male camel ‘ibn labun’(a young male camel which is two years old and already starting the third year). However, when the amount of camels reaches thirty-six, the due Zakah is a young she-camel 'bint labun’ (a young female camel, which is two years old and already starting the third year). When they reach forty six to sixty camels, their due Zakah is a she camel ‘hiqqah’ (which is three years old and starting the fourth). When they reach sixty-one to seventy-five, one ‘Jaz'ah’ (a four year old camel already starting its fifth year). When their number is between seventy-six to ninety camels, their due Zakah is two young she camels ‘bint labun’. When they are in the range between ninety-one to one hundred and twenty camels, the Zakah is two young she camels 'hiqqah’. If they are over a hundred and twenty camels, on every forty camels, one 'bint labun’ is due. And for every fifty camels (over one hundred and twenty) a young she-camel ‘hiqqah’ is due, And anyone, who has got only four camels, does not have to pay Zakah unless he (the owner of the camels) wants to give something voluntarily. Regarding the Zakah of grazing sheep, if they are between forty and one hundred and twenty, one sheep is due as Zakah. lf they are between 120 and 200, two sheep are due. If they are between 200 and 300, three sheep are due. If they exceed three hundred sheep, then one sheep is due for every extra hundred grazing heads. If the grazing sheep are less than forty, (even if they are 39) then no Zakah is due on them, unless he (the owner of the camels) wants to give something voluntarily.\nOne should not combine (i.e. gather young animals together) or separate them for fear of paying Zakah. When there is a mixture of cattle shared between two partners, and Zakah is paid jointly between them, then they have to calculate it equally among them (depending on the share of each). Neither an old or a defective animal nor a male goat (a ram used for breeding) may be taken as Zakah, unless the Zakah collector wishes to do so. Concerning silver, the Zakah paid is a quarter of a tenth for each 200 Dirhams. If the amount of silver is less than two hundred Dirhams (even if it is 190) then no Zakah is to be paid for it, unless the owner wishes to do so. If the number of camels reaches the number on which a jaz'ah (a four year old camel already starting its fifth year) is due as Zakah, but he only has a ‘hiqqah’ (a she camel which is three years old and starting the fourth), it should be accepted from him along with two sheep if they were available (to compensate for the difference) or twenty Dirhams. If on the other hand he has to offer a ‘hiqqah’ as Zakah, but he only has a jaz'ah, it is accepted from him, and the Zakah collector will then pay him the difference, which is twenty Dirhams or two female sheep.’ Related by AI-Bukhari."

He then started pronouncing the Talbiyuh, saying:\n\"Labbaika Allahumma labbaik labbaika la sharika laka labbaik, innal hamda wan-ni’mata laka wal mulk, la sharika lak (O Allah! I hasten to You. You have no partner. I hasten to You. All praise and grace is Yours and all Sovereignty too; You have no partner). When we came with him to the House (of Allah), he placed his hands on the Black Stone (Hajar al Aswad) and kis+sed it. He then started to make seven circuits (round the Ka’bah), doing ramal (trotting) in three of them and walking (at his normal pace) four other circuits. Then going to the place of Ibrahim (Maqam Ibrahim), there he prayed two rak'at. He then returned to the Black Stone (Hajar al Aswad) placed his hands on it and kissed it. Then he went out of the gate to Safa, and as he approached it, he recited: “Verily as-Safa and Marwah are among the signs appointed by Allah,\"(2:158), adding, “I begin with what Allah began.\" He first mounted as-Safa until he saw the House, and facing the Qiblah he declared the Oneness of Allah and glorified Him and said: ‘La ilaha illa-llah wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul mulk wa lahul hamd, wa huwa 'ala kulli shai’in qadeer, la ilaha illa-llahu wahdahu anjaza wa'dahu, wa nas ara 'abdahu, wa hazamal ahzaba wahdah’ (There is no God but Allah, He is One, and has no partner. His is the dominion, and His is the praise and He has Power over all things. There is no God but Allah alone, Who fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and defeated the confederates alone.\") He said these words three times making supplications in between. He then descended and walked towards Marwah, and when his feet touched the bottom of the valley, he ran; and when he began to ascend, he walked (at his normal pace) until he reached Marwah. There he did as he had done at Safa….\nWhen it was the day of Tarwiyah (8th of Dhul-Hijjah) they went to Mina and put on the Ihram for Hajj and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) rode his mount, and there he led the Dhur (noon), ‘Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (sunset), ‘Isha and Fajr (dawn) prayers. He then waited a little until the sun had risen, and commanded that a tent be pitched at Namirah (close to Arafat). The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), continued on until he came to Arafah and he found that the tent had been pitched for him at Namirah. There he got down until the sun had passed its meridian; he commanded that al-Qaswa’ be brought and saddled for him, then he came to the bottom of the valley, and addressed the people with the well-known sermon Khutbat al-Wada (the Farewell Sermon). Then the Adhan was pronounced and later on the Iqamah and the Prophet led the Dhuhr (noon) prayer. Then another Iqamah was pronounced and the Prophet led the Asr (afternoon) prayer and he observed no other prayer in between the two. The Messenger of Allah then mounted his camel and came to the place where he was to stay. He made his she-camel, al-Qaswa turn towards the rocky side, with the pedestrian path lying in front of him. He faced the Qiblah, and stood there until the sun set, and the yellow light diminished somewhat, and the disc of the sun totally disappeared. He pulled the nose string of al-Qaswa’ so forcefully that its head touched the saddle (in order to keep her under perfect control), and pointing with his right hand, advised the people to be moderate (in speed) saying: “O people! Calmness! Calmness!\" Whenever he passed over an elevated tract of land, he slightly loosened the nose-string of his camel until she climbed up. This is how he reached al-Muzdalifah. There he led the Maghrib (sunset) and Isha prayers with one Adhan, and two lqamas, and did not pray any optional prayers in between them. The Messenger of Allah then lay down until dawn and then offered the Fajr (dawn) prayer with an Adhan and an Iqamah when the morning light was clear. He again mounted al-Qaswa’, and when he came to Al-Mash‘ar Al-Haram (The Sanctuary Landmark, which is a small mountain at al-Muzdalifah) he faced the Qiblah, and supplicated to Allah, Glorified Him, and pronounced His Uniqueness and Oneness, and kept standing until the daylight was very clear. Then he set off quickly before the sun rose, until he came to the bottom of the valley of Muhassir where he urged her (al·Qaswa’) a little. He followed the middle road, which comes out at the greatest Jamarah (one of the three stoning sites called Jamrat-ul ‘Aqabah), he came to Jamarah which is near the tree. At this he threw seven small pebbles, saying, Allahu Akbar` while throwing each of them in a manner in which small pebbles are thrown (holding them with his fingers) and this he did while at the bottom of the valley. He then went to the Place of sacrifice, and sacrificed sixty-three (camels) with his own hand (he brought 100 camels with him and he asked ’Ali to sacrifice the rest). The Messenger of Allah again rode and came to the House (of Allah), where he performed Tawaf al-Ifada and offered the Dhuhr prayer at Makkah….’ Muslim transmitted this hadith through a very long narration describing the full details of the Hajj of the Prophet"

A man of his companions then stood up and said, \"O Allah's Messenger, if you have no need for her, marry her to me.\" He asked, \"Do you have anything (to give her as dowry)?\" He replied, \"No, I swear by Allah, O Allah's Messenger.\" He thereupon said, \"Go to your family and see if you can find something.\" He went and then returned and said, \"No, I swear by Allah I found nothing.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said, \"Look for something, even if it should be an iron ring.\" He went and then returned and said, \"No, I swear by Allah, O Allah's Messenger, not even an iron ring; but I have onl this lower garment of mine - [Sahl said, 'He had no upper garment'] - and I shall give her half of it.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then said, \"What will she do with your lower garment? For if you wear it, there would be nothing of it on her, and if she wears it, there would be nothing of it on you.\" The man then sat down and when he had sit for a long time he stood up and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saw him departing, so he commanded him and he was called back. When he came back, he said, \"What do you have (i.e. memorized) from the Qur'an?\" He replied, \"I have Surat such and such and Surat such and such,\" he counted them. He then asked \"Can you recited them by heart?\" He replied, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Go, for I have given her to you in marriage for the part of the Qur'an which you know.\"\n[Agreed upon; the wording is Muslim's].\nAnother narration has: \"Go for I have given her to you in marriage, so teach her some of Qur'an.\"\nA narration by al-Bukhari has: \"I have married her to you for the part of the Qur'an which you know.\""

Muhaiysah came and told them that 'Abdullah bin Sahl had been killed and thrown into a well. He came to the Jews and said to them, ‘I swear by Allah that you have killed him.’ They replied, ‘We swear by Allah that we have not killed him.' Then Muhaiysah came along with his brother Huwaiysah and 'Abdur Rahman bin Sahl to the Prophet (ﷺ) and Muhaiysah started to talk. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to him, “Let an older one speak (take charge of this matter).” So Huwaiysah narrated what happened and then Muhaiysah spoke. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said:\n“Either they pay the Diyah of your companion or be ready for war.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote to them about this and they wrote back saying, ‘By Allah, we have not killed him.’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) then said to Huwaiysah, Muhaiysah and 'Abdur Rahman bin Sahl, “Would you take an oath (that they killed him) and then you will be entitled to the Diyah of your companion” 'They answered, ‘No (as they did not witness the crime).’The Messenger of Allah then said, “Then the Jews should take an oath (that they are innocent).” They said, ‘They are not Muslims.’ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) thereupon paid the Diyah of the victim himself and sent them 100 camels. Sahl commented, ‘A red she-camel (of these 100 camels) kicked me.’ Agreed upon."

He then used to say “Go out for Jihad in Allah’s name, in the Cause of Allah, and fight those who disbelieve in Allah. Go out for Jihad and do not indulge in Ghulul, or be treacherous or mutilate (dead bodies) or kill a child. When you meet your enemy, or the polytheists, invite them to three courses of action, and accept whichever of them they are willing to agree to, and withhold from doing anything else:\nCall them to Islam, and if they agree accept it from them. Then invite them to migrate from their land to the land of the Emigrants (i.e. al-Madinah), if they refuse, then tell them they will be like the Muslim desert Arabs, thus they will have no right in the Ghanimah or Fai’ unless they participate in Jihad with the Muslims. If they refuse (to accept Islam) order them to pay the Jizyah and if they agree, accept it from them. If they refuse, seek Allah, the Most High’s help against them and fight them. When you besiege a fortress, and its people wish you to grant them the protection of Allah and His Prophet, grant them neither but grant them your protection, for it is less serious (a lesser guilt) to break your guarantee of protection than to break that of Allah’s. And if they offer to capitulate under the condition that they are subjected to the judgment of Allah, do not grant them this, but judge according to your own command, for you do not know whether or not you will be able to carry out Allah, the Most High’s Judgment regarding them.” Related by Muslim."
