He said: No, not until you tell us what happened when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out and you were with him. Abu Bakr said: We started our journey at the beginning of the night and we hastened for one day and one night, until it was midday. I looked into the distance to see whether there was anywhere to seek shade, and I saw a rock, so I went to it and it had a little shade. I smoothed the ground for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and spread a garment of camel hair for him, and said: Lie down and rest, O Messenger of Allah. So he lay down, and I went out to see if I could spot anyone looking for us. Then I saw a shepherd and I said: Who do you belong to, O boy? He said: To a man of Quraish. He mentioned his name and I recognised it. I said: Is there any milk in your sheep? He said: Yes | said: Will you milk some for me? He said: Yes. I told him to do that, so he caught a sheep, then I told him to brush the dust from its teat, then to brush the dust off his hands. I had a small vessel with me on the neck of which was a cloth. He milked a little bit of milk for me and I poured it into the vessel until it cooled down. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When I reached him, he had already woken up. I said: Drink, O Messenger of Allah. He drank until I was pleased, then I said: Is it time to move on? So we moved on and the people were coming after us but none of them caught up with us except Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju'shum, who was riding a horse of his, I said: O Messenger of Allah, someone has caught up with us. He said: `Do not be afraid, for Allah is with us.` When he got close to us, and there was no more between us and him then the length of a spear or two or three spears, I said: O Messenger of Allah, this pursuer has caught up with us, and I wept. He said: `Why are you weeping?` I said: I am not weeping for myself; rather I am weeping for you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed against him [the pursuer] and said: “O Allah, protect us from him by whatever means You will.” Then his horse's legs sank into the solid ground up to its belly, and he fell off it. He said: O Muhammad, I know that this is because of you; pray to Allah to save me from my predicament, and by Allah I shall divert away from you any one who is behind me of those who are seeking you. Here is my quiver, take one arrow. You are going to pass by some camels and sheep of mine in such and such a place, take whatever you need from thern. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `I have no need of it.“ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed for him and he was released, and he went back to his companions. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and I continued on our way until we came to Madinah, where the people met him. They came out on the road and on the roofs, and a lot of servants and children crowded the road saying: Allahu Akbar, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has come, Muhammad has come. The people disputed as to who he would stay with. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Tonight I will stay with Banun-Najjar, the maternal uncles of 'Abdul-Muttalib, to honour them thereby.” The next morning, he went where he was instructed. Al-Bara' bin 'Azib said: The first of the Muhajireen to come to us was Mus'ab bin 'Umair, the brother of Banu 'Abdud-Dar. Then Ibn Umm Maktoom, the blind man and brother of Banu Fihr, came to us. Then 'Umar bin al-Khattab, came to us with twenty riders and we said: What happened to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? He said: He is behind me. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came and Abu Bakr was with him. Al-Bara said: the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not come until I had read some soorahs from al-Mufassal [Al-Mufassal is that portion of the Qur'an which goes from Qaf to an-Nas]. Isra'eel said: al-Bara' was one of the Ansar from Banu Harithah."

Then he sat where he was until he had prayed Zuhr, 'Asr and Maghrib, and he did not speak until he had prayed 'isha'. Then he got up and went to his family. The people said to Abu Bakr: Why don't you ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) what is the matter? He did something today that he never did before. So he asked him and he said: `Yes, I was shown what is to come of this world and the Hereafter. The earlier and later generations were gathered in one place and the people got terrified because of that. They went to Adam when the sweat was about to reach their mouths, and they said: O Adam, you are the father of mankind and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose you. Intercede for us with your Lord, He said: I am in the same position as you. Go to your father after your father, to Nooh, “Allah chose Adam, Nooh (Noah), the family of Ibraheem (Abraham) and the family of 'Imran above the 'Alameen (mankind and jinn) (of their times)` (Al 'Imran 3:33}.\nThen they will go to Nooh and will say: Intercede with your Lord for us, for Allah chose you and answered your supplication, and He did not leave one of the disbelievers on the Earth (cf. 71:26). He will say: I am not the one you want; go to Ibraheem for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, took him as a close friend (khaleel). So they will go to Ibraheem but he will say: I am not the one you want; go to Moosa, for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, spoke directly to him (cf. 4:164). But Moosa will say: I am not the one you want; go to 'Eesa Ibn Maryam, for he healed those born blind and the lepers, and he brought forth the dead. But 'Eesa will say: I am not the one you want; go to the leader of the sons of Adam, for he is the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection. Go to Muhammad, for he will intercede for you with your Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. Then (the Prophet) will go and Jibreel will come to his Lord and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Give him permission and give him the glad tidings of Paradise. Jibreel will take him and he will fall down in prostration for a week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intercession will be accepted. So he will raise his head, and when he looks at his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, he will fall down in prostration for another week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intersession will be accepted. He will start to fall down in prostration again, but Jibreel (peace be upon him) will take hold of his upper arms and Allah, may he be glorified and exalted, will inspire him to offer a supplication such as no human being was ever inspired with. He will say: `O Lord, You created me as the leader of the sons of Adam, and no boast; the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection, and no boast; there will come to my Cistern more people than there can be between San‘a’ and Allah (Eilat).` Then it will be said: Call the Siddeeq's so that they might intercede. Then it will be said: Call the Prophets. So one Prophet will come with a group, and another Prophet will come with five or six people, and another Prophet will come with nobody. Then it will be said: Call the martyrs so that they might intercede for whoever they want. When the martyrs do that, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: I am the Most Merciful of those who show mercy; I admit to My Paradise anyone who does not associate anything with Me.\nSo they will enter Paradise. Then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look in Hell; can you find anyone who ever did anything good? And they will find a man in Hell, and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that I was easy-going with people in buying and selling. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Be easy-going with My slave as he was easygoing with My slaves. Then they will bring a man out of Hell and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that l instructed my sons: When I die, burn me with fire, then grind me until I am like kohl powder. Then take me to the sea and scatter me in the wind, for by Allah the Lord of the Worlds will never be able to punish me. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Why did you do that? He will say: For fear of You. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look at the kingdom of the greatest king and you will have the like thereof and ten times as much. He will say: Are You making fun of me when You are the Sovereign? He (the Prophet (ﷺ) said: “That is what I was smiling at, at the time of the foremoon.`"

Fatimah lived for six months after the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and she used to ask Abu Bakr for her share of that which the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had left behind of Khaibar and Fadak, and his charitable endowments in Madinah, but Abu Bakr refused to give her that. He said: I will not stop doing something that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to do; rather I will continue to do it. I am afraid that if I give up something that he did, I will go astray. As for his charitable endowment in Madinah, 'Umar gave it to 'Ali and 'Abbas, but ‘Ali took most of it. As for Khaibar and Fadak, 'Umar kept them and said: They are the charitable endowment of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and were spent on his responsibilities and on emergencies. They were to be cared for by whoever became caliph, and this remains the case until today."

      "text": "It was narrated from Anas bin Malik that Abu Bakr wrote to thern saying:\nThese are the types of charity (zakah) that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) made obligatory upon the Muslims and which Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, enjoined upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). Whoever among the Muslims is asked to pay it in the proper manner, let him give it; whoever is asked for more than that, let him not give it. For less than twenty-five camels, for each five, one sheep (should be given). If the number reaches twenty-five, then one she-camel in its second year (should be given), up to thirty-five. If there is no she-camel in its second year, then a he-camel in its third year (may be given). If the number reaches thirty-six, then a she-camel in its third year (should be given), up to forty-five. If the number reaches forty-six, then a she-camel in its fourth year that has been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to sixty, If the number reaches sixty-one, then a she-camel in its fifth year (should be given), up to seventy five. If the number reaches seventy-six, then two she-camels in their second year (should be given), up to ninety. If the number reaches ninety-one, then two she camels in their fourth year that have been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to one hundred and twenty. If the number is more than one hundred and twenty, then for every forty camels, a she-camel limits third year should be given and for every fifty a she-camel in its fourth year. If the ages of the camels for zakah differ, if what is due is a she-camel in its fifth year but he does not own such a camel, but he has a she-camel in its fourth year, then that will be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, if available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she-camel in its fourth year and he only has a she camel in its fifth year, it should be accepted from him and the zakat collector should give him back twenty dirhams or two sheep. If what is due from him is a shecamel in its fourth year, but he does not have such a cameland he has a she-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, is available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she camel in its second year, but he only has a he-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and nothing should be added to it. If he has only four camels, no zakah is due unless the owner wants to give it. With regard to zakah on sheep in the pasture, if there are forty sheep, then one sheep is due as zakah, up to one hundred and twenty sheep. of there is one more than that, then two sheep are due, up to two hundred. If there is one more than that then three sheep are due, up to three hundred. If there is one more than that, then for every hundred sheep, one sheep is due No toothless or defective sheep should be taken as zakah and neither should a ram, unless the one who is giving allows that. Separate flocks should not be put together and flocks should not be divided so as to avoid or reduce zakah. If there are two partners [and the zakah-collector comes and takes zakah), they should settle the matter between them on a fair basis. If a man's flock is grazing if it is one less than forty, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it. On silver the zakah is one quarter of one tenth; if the wealth is only one hundred and ninety dirhams, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it."

I told this dream to Asma’ bint 'Umais, the wife of Abu Bakr , and she said: You will be killed by a Persian man. The people are asking me to appoint a successor, but Allah will not cause His religion and His caliphate, with which He sent His Prophet ﷺ to be lost. If death comes to me soon, then the caliphate is to be decided by these six men with whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was pleased when he died. Whichever of them you swear allegiance to, then listen to him and obey. I know that some people will object to this matter. I have fought them with my own hands in the defence of Islam.\nThey are the enemies of Allah and misguided kafirs. By Allah, I am not leaving behind anything that my Lord instructed me to do and I came to the position of caliphate on that basis that is more important to me than kalalah. By Allah, the Prophet of Allah ﷺ never emphasised any issue to me since I accompanied him more than the issue of kalalah, until he poked me in the chest with his finger and said: `Is not ayatas-saif (the verse of summer, i.e., it was revealed in summer), which appears at the end of Sooratan Nisa', sufficient for you?` If I live I will issue a decree that will be so clear that those who read the Qur'an and those who do not read it will be able to make decisions concerning it. I call upon Allah to bear witness over the governors of the regions, for I only sent them to be just and to teach the people their religion and the Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ and to refer to me concerning any difficult matter. O people, you eat two plants which I find to be nothing but repugnant, this onion and garlic. I remember the Messenger of Allah ﷺ, if he noticed their smell coming from a man in the mosque, he would issue orders that he taken out from the mosque to al-Baqee'. Whoever must eat them, let him cook them to death.”\nHe said: He addressed the people on Friday and was attacked on Wednesday."

I went and stood before him and said: O Messenger of Allah, (will you offer the funeral prayer) for the enemy of Allah who said such and such? and I listed what he had done.

If I knew that by asking for forgiveness more than seventy times they would be forgiven, I would have done that.` He said: Then he offered the funeral prayer for him, and walked with him (his bier), and stood by his grave until the burial was completed. He said: I was astounded that I had spoken so audaciously to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ; Allah and His Messenger know best. By Allah, it was not long before these two verses were revealed: “And never (O Muhammad pray (funeral prayer) for any of them (hypocrites) who dies, nor stand at his grave. Certainly they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and died while they were Fasiqoon (rebellious, - disobedient to AIlah and His Messenger).`[at-Tawbah9:84].

The Prophet of Allah(ﷺ) turned to face the qiblah, then he stretched forth his hands, wearing his upper and lower garment, and he said: “O Allah, where is Your promise to me? O Allah, accomplish for me what You have promised me! O Allah, if this small band of Muslims is destroyed, You will never be worshipped on earth.” He kept beseeching his Lord, calling out to Him, until his upper garment fell from his shoulders. Abu Bakr came to him, picked up his upper garment and put it on him. Then he embraced him from behind and said: O Prophet of Allah, this prayer of yours to your Lord will suffice, for He will accomplish for you what He has promised to you. Then Allah revealed the words: `(Remember) when you sought help of your Lord and He answered you (saying): ‘I will help you with a thousand of the angels each behind the other (following one another) in succession` [al Anfal 8:9). On that day when the armies met (in battle), Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, defeated the mushrikeen; seventy of their men were killed and seventy were taken captive. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) consulted Abu Bakr, 'Ali and 'Umar رضي الله عنهم (concerning the prisoners). Abu Bakr said: O Prophet of Allah, they are our cousins, kinsmen and brothers, I think that you should accept a ransom for them, which will strengthen us against the kuffar, and perhaps Allah will guide them to Islam and they will become a support to us. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “What do you think, O son of al-Khattab?` I said: No, by Allah. I do not think as Abu Bakr thinks. I think that you should hand. So and so ­ a relative of ʼUmar's- ­ over\nto me so that I may strike his neck. You should hand ‘Aqeel over to ‘Ali so that he may strike his neck, and you should hand over So and so to Hamzah (his brother) so that he may strike his neck, so that Allah will know that we have no mercy in our hearts towards the mushrikeen; these are\ntheir prominent figures and leaders. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) inclined towards the view of Abu Bakr, and he did not incline towards what I said, and accepted ransoms from them. The next day, I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and found him with Abu Bakr, and they were both weeping I said: O Messenger of Allah , tell me why you and your companion are weeping. If I find it is a cause for weeping, I will weep too, and is it is not, then I will make myself weep with you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `I am weeping because of what your companions suggested about accepting a ransom for the prisoners. I have been shown your punishment as close as this tree` ­ a tree that was close to the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) Then Allah revealed the words:`It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land. You desire the good of this world (i.e. the money of ransom for freeing the captives), but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter. And Allah is Almighty, All Wise. Were it not a previous ordainment from Allah, a severe torment would have touched you for what you took `[al Anfal 8:67­-68] ­ i.e., referring to the ransom. Then booty was permitted to them, and when the day of Uhud came the following year, they were punished for what they had done of taking the\nransom on the day of Badr. Seventy of them were killed and the Companions of the Prophet deserted him, his front tooth was broken and the helmet on his head was broken, and blood flowed down his face, and Allah revealed the words: “When a single disaster smites you, although you smote (your enemies) with one twice as great, you say: 'From where does this come to us?`Say (to them), ‘It is from yourselves (because of your evil deeds).' And Allah has power over all things” [Al 'Imran 3:165]"

      "text": "lbn 'Abbas narrated that 'Umar bin al-Khattab said:\nOn the day of Badr, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) looked at his companions and they were three hundred and some, then he looked at the mushrikeen and saw that they were one thousand or more. The Prophet of Allah (ﷺ) turned to face the qiblah, then he stretched forth his hands, wearing his upper and lower garment, and he said: “O Allah, where is Your promise to me? O Allah, accomplish for me what You have promised me! O Allah, if this small band of Muslims is destroyed, You will never be worshiped on earth.” He kept beseeching his Lord, calling out to Him, until his upper garment fell from his shoulders. Abu Bakr came to him, picked up his upper garment and put it back on him. Then he embraced him from behind and said, “O Prophet of Allah, this prayer of yours to your Lord will suffice, for He will accomplish for you what He has promised to you.” Then Allah revealed the words: “(Remember) when you sought help of your Lord and He answered you (saying): ‘I will help you with a thousand of the angels each behind the other (following one another) in succession’” (al-Anfal 8:9). On that day when the armies met (in battle), Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, caused the mushrikeen to be defeated, seventy of their men were killed and seventy were taken captive. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) consulted Abu Bakr, ‘Ali and ʼUmar (concerning the prisoners). Abu Bakr said, “O Prophet of Allah, they are our cousins, kinsmen and brothers. I think that you should accept a ransom for them, which will strengthen us against the kuffar, and perhaps Allah will guide them to Islam and they will become a support to us.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, “What do you think, O son of al-Khattab?” I said: No, by Allah. I do not think as Abu Bakr thinks. I think that you should hand so and so—a relative of ‘Umar's—to me so that I may strike his neck, You should hand ‘Aqeel over to ‘Ali so that he may strike his neck, and you should hand over so and so to Hamzah (his brother) so that he may strike his neck, so that Allah will know that we have no mercy in our hearts towards the mushrikeen; these are their prominent figures and leaders. But the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) inclined towards the view of Abu Bakr, and he did not incline towards what I said, and accepted ransoms from them. The next day. I came to the Prophet (ﷺ) and found him with Abu Bakr, and they were both weeping. I said, “O Messenger of Allah, tell me why you and your companion are weeping. If I find it is a cause for weeping. I will weep too, and if it is not, then I will make myself weep with you.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, “I am weeping because of what your companions suggested about accepting a ransom for the prisoners. I have been shown your punishment as close as this tree”—a tree that was close to the Prophet of Allah (ﷺ). Then Allah revealed the words: “It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land. You desire the good of this world (i.e. the money of ransom for freeing the captives), but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter, And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. Were it not a previous ordainment from Allah, a severe torment would have touched you for what you took.” [al-Anfal 8:67-68] i.e., referring to the ransom. Then booty was permitted to them, and when the day of Uhud came the following year, they were punished for what they had done for taking the ransom on the day of Badr. Seventy of them were killed and the Companions of the Prophet deserted him; his front tooth was broken and the helmet on his head was broken, and blood flowed down his face, and Allah revealed the words: “When a single disaster smites you, although you smote (your enemies) with one twice as great, you say: ‘From where does this come to us?’ Say (to them), ‘It is from yourselves (because of your evil deeds).’ And Allah has power over all things” [Al ‘Imran 3:165]"

      "text": "It was narrated that ibn 'Abbas said:\nI was eager to ask 'Umar about the two wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) concerning whom Allah said, “If you two (wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) turn in repentance\nto Allah, (it will be better for you), your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet (ﷺ) likes)” [at-Tahreem 66:4], until 'Umar went for Hajj and I went with him. When we were partway there, 'Umar turned aside and I turned aside with him, bringing the jug. He relieved himself, then he came to me and I poured water onto his hands, and he did wudoo’. I said: “O Ameer al -Mu'mineen, who are the two wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) of whom Allah said: ‘If you two (wives of the Prophet (ﷺ)) turn in repentance to Allah, (it will be better for you), your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet (ﷺ) likes)’?” [at-Tahreem 66:4] 'Umar said, “How strange of you, O Ibn 'Abbas”, (az-Zuhri said: By Allah, he did not like the question, but he did not conceal anything.) He said, “They were Hafsah and 'A'ishah.” Then he started to narrate the hadeeth and said: We people of Quraish were a people who dominated women, but when we came to Madinah we found a people who were dominated by their women, and our women started to learn from their women. My house was among Banu Umayyah bin Zaid in al-'Awali. One day I got angry with my wife, and she argued with me. I did not like her to argue with me, but she said: Do you not like me to argue with you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) argue with him, and one of them will forsake him all day until night comes, I went and entered upon Hafsah, and I said: Do\nyou argue with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? She said: Yes. I said: Does one of you forsake him all day until night comes? She said: Yes. I said: Any one of you who does that is doomed and lost. Does any one of you feel assured that Allah will not be angry with her because of the anger of His\nMessenger (ﷺ), for then she will be doomed? Do not argue with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and do not ask him for anything. Ask me for whatever you want. And do not be misled by the fact that your neighbour is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) than\nyou – referring to 'A'ishah. And ‘Umar said: I had a neighbour among the Ansar. We used to take turns to go down to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He would go down one day and I would go down the next. He would bring me the news of the Revelation and other things, and I would do likewise.\nWe were saying that Ghassan were shoeing their horses to attack us. My friend went down, then he came to me at night and knocked on my door, then he called out to me. I went out to him and he said: Something terrible has happened! I said: What? Have Ghassan come? He said: No, it is more terrible than that and worse. The Prophet (ﷺ) has divorced his wives! I said: Hafsah is doomed and lost! I thought that this would happen. Then when I had prayed Fajr, I got dressed, then I went down and entered upon Hafsah, who was weeping. I said: Has the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)divorced you? She said: I do not know. He has secluded himself in this loft. I went to a black slave of his and said: Ask for permission for ‘Umar to enter. He went in, then he came out to me and said: I mentioned you to him but he did not say anything, I went away and came to the minbar, where I sat down. By it was a group of people, some of whom were weeping. I sat for a little while, then I could not bear it any longer, so I went to the slave and said: Ask for permission for ‘Umar to enter. He went in, then he came out to me and said: I mentioned you to him but he did not say anything. I turned to leave, then the slave called me and said: Go in, he has given you permission. So I went in and greeted the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) with salam. He was resting on a reed mat that had left marks on his side. I said: O Messenger of Allah, have you divorced your wives? He looked up at me and said, “No.” I said: Allah Akbar! if you had seen us, O Messenger of Allah, we Quraish were a people who dominated women, but when we came to Madinah we found a people who were dominated by their women, and our women started to learn from their women. I got angry with my wife one day, and she started to argue with me. I did not like her to argue with me, but she said: Do you not like me to argue with you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) argue with him, and one of them will forsake him all day until night comes. I said: Any one of them who does that is doomed and lost. Does one of them feel assured that Allah will not be angry with her because of the anger of His Messenger (ﷺ),then she will be doomed? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled. I said: O Messenger of Allah, I entered upon Hafsah and I said: Do not be misled by the fact that your neighbour (i.e. ‘Aa'ishah) is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) than you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) smiled again. I said: O Messenger of Allah, may I speak to you freely? He said: “Yes.” So I sat down and looked around the room, and by Allah, I did not see anything in it to please the eye except three hides. I said: Pray to Allah, O Messenger of Allah, to make life prosperous for your ummah, for He has made life prosperous for the Persians and Romans, but they do not worship Allah, may He be glorified and exalted. He sat up straight and said: “Are you doubting. O son of al-Khattab? They are people whose good things have been hastened for them in this world.” I said: Pray for forgiveness for me, O Messenger of Allah. He had sworn that he would not enter upon them for a month, because he was so annoyed with them until Allah rebuked him."

      "text": "It was narrated that Abu Firas suid:\n`Umar bin al-Khattab gave a speech and said: O people, we used to know you when the Prophet (ﷺ) was among us and revelation was coming down to him; Allah would tell us about you. But now the Prophet (ﷺ) has passed away and revelation has ceased, and now the way to judge you is this whoever among you shows us good conduct, we will think well of him and love him; whoever among you shows us bad conduct, we will think badly of him and hate him for that, and whatever is in your hearts is between you and your Lord. There was a time when I used to think that whoever learned the Qur`an, seeking thereby Allah and (the reward that) is with Him, would be rewarded in the Hereafter, but some men learned Qur`an seeking that which is with people. So seek Allah by learning Qur`an and by your good deeds. By Allah, I do not send my workers to strike you or seize your wealth; rather I send them to you to teach you your religion and Sunnah, whoever has done to him something other than that, let him refer it to me, for by the One in Whose hand is my soul, I shall surely grant him retaliation. `Amr bin al-`As stood up and said: O Ameer al Mu`mineen, do you think if one of the Muslims was in charge of some people and he disciplined one of them, would you allow that one to settle the score with him? He said: Yes, by the One in Whose hand is the soul of `Umar, I would not certainly allow him to settle the score with him. I saw the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) do that with regard to himself. But do not strike the Muslims and thus humiliate them, and do not keep them away from their wives on campaign for too long and thus expose them to temptation. Do not withhold from them their due rights and cause them to rebel; and do not make them camp in an area with a lot of trees, because that will cause them to be scattered.\nIt was narrated that ‘Abul-`Ajfa` as-Sulami said: I heard ‘Umar say: Do not make women`s dowries expensive,... and he mentioned the same hadeeth."

Ibn ‘Abbas came, led by a guide, who told him where Ibn ‘Umar was. He came and sat beside me, so I was between them, and we heard a voice from inside the house, Ibn `Umar said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: `The deceased is tormented because of the crying of his family.` He said: And `Abdullah understood it as general in meaning. Ibn `Abbas said: We were with Ameer al-Muʼmineen ‘Umar until we came to some arid land, where we found a man who had halted in the shade of a tree. He said to me: Go and find out for me who that man is, I went and found that it was Suhaib. I came back to him and said: You told me to find out for you who that man is; it is Suhaib. He said: Tell him to join us. I said: He has his family with him. He said: Even if he has his family with him [and perhaps Ayyoob said on one occasion:Tell him to join us). When we came to Madinah, it was not long before Ameer al Muʼmineen [ʼUmar} was attacked. Suhaib came, saying O my brother, O my friend! `Umar said: Do you not know, or have you not heard, that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `The deceased is tormented because of some of his family`s crying.” “Abdullah understood it as general in meaning, but ‘Umar said: some of [their] weeping. I went to `A`ishah, and I told her what Ibn `Umar had said. She said: No, by Allah, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not say, “The deceased is tormented because of the weeping of anyone.” Rather he said: “Allah increases the torment of the kafir because of his family`s weeping, and that it is He (Allah) Who makes (whom He wills) laugh, and makes (whom He wills) weep, “And no bearer of burdens shall bear another`s burden` [Al Anʼam 6:164].” Ayyoob said: Ibn Abu Mulaikah said: al-Qasim bin Muhammad told me: When `Aʼishah heard what ʼUmar and Ibn `Umar had said, she said. You are narrating to me from two who are not liars and are not to be suspected of being liars, but one may mishear.\n`Abdullah bin Abi Mulaikah narrated… and he mentioned a hadeeth similar to that of Ayyoob, except that he said: ibn `Umar said to `Amr bin `Uthman, when he was facing him: Why don`t you tell them not to weep? For the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `The deceased is tormented because of his family`s weeping for him.`"

He said. As for your glad tidings to me of Paradise - `Affan [another narrator] said: No by Allah besides Whom there is no god- if I had the entire world and all that is in it, I would give it as a ransom from the terror of what lies before me, even before knowing the outcome.

He praised and glorified Allah, then he mentioned the Prophet (ﷺ) of Allah and Abu Bakr, then he said:\n`I have seen a dream, in which I saw myself being pecked by a rooster twice, and I think it signals my death. The people are telling me to appoint a caliph after me. Allah will not cause His caliphate or His religion to be lost, or that with which He sent His Prophet (ﷺ). If I die, then the caliphate is to be decided by a council of these six men with whom the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was pleased when he died, then whichever of them you swear allegiance to, listen to him and obey. I know that there are some men then who will seek to undermine this matter, and I have sought them with these two hands of mine in support of Islam. It they do that, then those are the enemies of Allah, the misguided disbelievers. By Allah, I am not leaving behind anything of more concern to me than kalalah. I asked the Prophet (ﷺ) of Allah about it and he never spoke to me in such a harsh manner as he did with regard to that, to such an extent that he poked me in the chest or side with his hand or his finger and said: `O `Umar: The verse at the end of Soorah an Nisa’ that was revealed in summer is sufficient for you.” If I live, I will pass a judgement concerning it that no one who reads Qur`an or who does not read Qur`an will dispute. Then `Umar said: O Allah, bear witness concerning the governors of the regions; I sent them to teach the people their religion and the Sunnah of their Prophet (ﷺ), and to divide the sai` among them, and to judge between them on a fair basis, and whatever they found difficult they were to refer to me. Then he said: O people, you eat two plants that I think are nothing but distasteful, this garlic and onion. At the time of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I would see that is the smell of these things was found on a man, he would be taken by the hand and led out to al-Baqee`. Whoever must eat them, let him cook them to death.ʻUmar said this in a khutbah on Friday, and was stabbed on Wednesday 26 Dhul Hijjah."

He said: We will convey from you what you have said and we will do as we were instructed. So he burned the door. Then he [Sa`d] offered some supplies (to the envoy) but he refused. He left at midday and went to ‘Umar(رضي الله عنه), and he went and came back within nineteen days. He said: Were it not that I think well of you, I would have thought that you did not convey my message. He said: Yes I did convey it, he conveys his salam and apologises, and he swore by Allah that he did not say that. He said: Did he give you any provisions?

      "text": "It was narrated from `Ubaidullah bin ‘Abdullah bin `Utbah bin Mas`ood that Ibn `Abbas told him that ‘AbdurRahman bin ‘Awf went back to where he had halted. Ibn `Abbas said:\nI used to recite to ‘AbdurRahman bin ‘Awf, and he found me waiting for him. That was in Mina during the last Hajj performed by `Umar bin al-Khattab (رضي الله عنه) Abdur-Rahman bin `Awf said: A man came to `Umar bin al-Khattab and said: So and so is saying: If `Umar (رضي الله عنه) dies, I will swear allegiance to So and so. ʼUmar (رضي الله عنه) said: I will stand before the people today and warn them against these people who want to deprive them of their rights, `Abdur-Rahman said: I said: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, do not do that, for the Hajj season brings together the riffraff and rabble among the people, and most of the people who gather around and listen to you will be of that type. Is you stand before the people, I am afraid that you will say something that they will spread and not understand it properly or interpret it properly. Rather wait until you come to Madinah, for it is the land of Hijrah and the Sunnah, and you will meet the most knowledgeable and noble people there, and you can say what you want to say with confidence; they wilt understand what you say and will interpret it correctly, `Umar (رضي الله عنه) said: If I reach Madinah safe and sound, I shall certainly talk to the people there in the first speech I deliver. When we came to Madinah at the end of Dhul-I-Iijah, it was a Friday. I set out early, ‘Umar did not care at what time he went out, because he did not pay attention to heat and cold and so on. I found Sa`eed bin Zaid at the right-hand corner of the minbar, he had got there before me. I sat down next to him, with my knee touching his knee, and it was not long before `Umar (رضي الله عنه)came. When I saw him, I said: He will certainly speak today on this minbar and say something that no one ever heard before. Sa`eed bin Zaid objected to that and said: What do you think he will say that no one said before? `Umar (رضي الله عنه)sat on the minbar, and when the mu`dhdhin fell silent, he stood up and praised and glorified Allah as He deserves, then he said: To proceed o people, I am going to tell you something that it has been decreed I should say. I do not know, perhaps it may signal my death. So whoever understands it and remembers it, let him narrate it to others wherever his mount takes him; whoever does not understand il, it is not permissible for him to tell lies about me. Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, sent Muhammad (ﷺ) with the truth and revealed the Book to him; among the things that were revealed to him was the verse of stoning [adulterers). We read it and understood it; the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) stoned [adulterers] and we stoned adulterers] after him. But I fear that with the passage of time, some people will say: We do not find the verse of stoning in the Book of Allah, thus they will go astray by forsaking an obligation that Allah revealed. Stoning is the due punishment in the Book of Allah for those who commit zina, both men and women, if they have been married and if proof is established, or there is a pregnancy or a confession, And we used to recite: Do not claim to be the offspring of anyone other than your fathers, as it is disbelief (or ingratitude) on your part to claim to be the offspring of anyone other than your fathers, Verily the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Do not praise me excessively as `Eesa, the son of Maryam, was praised; rather I am the slave of Allah, so say, the slave of Allah and His Messenger.` I have heard that some among you are saying. If `Umar (رضي الله عنه) dies, I shall swear allegiance to So and so. No man should deceive himself by saying that the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was is successful. There is no doubt that this is the case, but Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, saved the to 2 people from its bad consequences and there is no one among you today who has the qualities of Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) What happened to us when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) died was that ‘Ali, az-Zubair and those who were with them stayed behind in the house of Fatimah, the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), and all the Ansar stayed behind and gathered in Saqeefat Banu Sa`idah, whilst the Muhajireen gathered around Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) I said to him; O Abu Bakr, let us go to our brothers, the Ansar. So we set out, looking for them, then we were met by two righteous men who told us what the people had done, and said: where are you going, O Muhajireen? I said: We are looking for these brothers of ours, the Ansar, They said. You should not go near them; do whatever you have already decided, O Muhajireen. I said: By Allah, we will go to them. So we carried on until we came to them in Saqeefat Banu Sa`idah, where we found them gathered and among them was a man wrapped up [in a garment. I said: Who is this? They said: Sa`d bin `Ubadah. ! said: What is the matter with him? They said: He is sick. After we sat down, their spokesman stood up and praised and glorified Allah, may He glorified and exalted, as He deserves, then he said: To proceed. We are the supporters (Ansar) of Allah and the majority of the Muslim army. You, O Muhajireen, are a small group among us. Some of you came to us, wanting to deny who we are and prevent us from attaining a position of authority. When he fell silent, I wanted to present a speech that I had prepared and that I liked in front of Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) I used to avoid provoking him and he was more forbearing and more dignified than me. But Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) said: Wait a while. I did not like to make him angry, and he was more knowledgeable and more dignified than me. By Allah, he did not omit any word that I liked in the speech I had prepared but he said something like it or better, speaking spontaneously, until he finished speaking. Then he said: To proceed. Whatever you have mentioned about your achievements and virtues, is correct. The Arabs would not acknowledge the leadership of anyone except someone from this tribe of Quraish, for they are the best of the Arabs in lineage and location. I am pleased to suggest to you one of these two men, whichever of them you want. Then he took hold of my hand and the hand of Abu `Ubaidah bin al-Jarrah, and I disliked nothing of what he had said apart from this, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck struck for no sin on my part than to become the leader of people among whom was Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) unless my own self suggested something at the time of death. One of the Ansar said: I am the post on which the camel with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree [i.e., a noble]. [I suggest] a ruler from among us and a ruler from among you, O Quraish. - I the narrator said to Malik; What does ‘I am the post on which the cainc! with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree` mean? He said:It is as if he is saying, I am the smart one who has the answer. - Then there was a great deal of clamour and raised voices, to such an extent that I feared there would be a conflict, so I said: Hold out your hand, O Abu Bakr. So he held out his hand and I swore allegiance to him, and the Muhajireen swore allegiance to him, then the Ansar swore allegiance to him. Thus we surrounded Sa`d bin ‘Ubadah. One of them said: You have killed Sa`d i said: May Allah kill Sa’d! And `Umar (رضي الله عنه) said: By Allah, we never encountered any problem greater than the swearing of allegiance to Abu Bakr (رضي الله عنه) . We were afraid that if we left the people without having sworn allegiance to anyone, they might swear allegiance after we were gone, so we would either follow in their footsteps and swear allegiance to someone we were not pleased with, or we would disagree with them and that would cause trouble. If anyone swears allegiance to a leader without consulting the Muslims, there is no allegiance for him and no allegiance to the one who swore allegiance to him, lest both of them be killed. Malik said: Ibn Shihab told me, from `Urwah bin az-Zubair, that the men whom they met were `Uwaim bin Sa`idah and Ma`n bin `Adiyy. Ibn Shihab said. Sa`eed bin al-Musayyab told me that the one who said, I am the post on which the camel with a skin disease scratches itself and I am like a high class palm tree, was al-lubab bin al-Mundhir."

Sometimes many soorahs would be revealed (incomplete) to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) , and when something was revealed he would call one of the scribes to write it down for him and say: `Put this in the soorah in which such and such is mentioned`; and verses would be revealed to him and he would say, `Put these verses in the soorah in which such and such is mentioned`; and a verse would be revealed to him and he would say: `Put this verse in the soorah in which such and such is mentioned.` Al-Anfal was one of the first soorahs to be revealed in Madinah and Bara`ah was one of the last soorahs of the Qur`an, and the content of the two soorahs was similar.

Then he put al-Fadl behind him (on his mount) and carried on until he came to the Jamrah. He stoned it, then he came to the place of sacrifice and said: `This is the place of sacrifice and all of Mina is a place of sacrifice.` He [the narrator] said: A young woman of Khath’am asked him: My father is an old man and has become senile; he has lived until Allah made Hajj obligatory, Will it be acceptable if I perform Hajj on his behalf? He said: `Yes; perform Hajj on behalf of your father.` And he twisted al Fadl`s neck (to turn his face away). Al-`Abbas said to him: O Messenger of Allah, why did you twist the neck of your cousin? He said: `I saw a young man and a young woman and I was not certain that they would be safe from the Shaitan.` Then a man came to him and said: O Messenger of Allah, I shaved my head before offering a sacrifice. He said: “Offer your sacrifice, there is no problem.” Then another man came to him and said: O Messenger of Allah, I did tawafal-ifadah before shaving my head. He said: “Shave your head or cut your hair, there is no problem.` Then he came to the Ka`bah and circumambulated it, then he came to Zamzam and said: `O Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib, it is your right to draw water for pilgrims. Were it not that the people would overwhelm you, I would have drawn water myself.`"

He said: `No problem, go ahead and shave your head.” Then another man came to him and said: I stoned the Jamrah and shaved my head and put on my ordinary clothes, but I did not offer the sacrifice.

Then he said: “Draw water, O Banu `Abdul-Muttalib, Were it not that you would be overwhelmed, I would have drawn water myself.” Al-`Abbas said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), why did I see you turning your cousin`s face away?

I will judge between you, and if you agree then that is the verdict, otherwise keep away from one another until you go to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he will be the one who judges between you, then whoever transgresses after that will have no right. Collect from the tribes of those who fell into the hole one quarter of the diyah [blood money], one third of the diyah, one half of the diyah and a complete diyah. For the first man (who fell in) there will be one quarter, because he caused the death of the one who came after him; for the second one there is one third of the diyah; and for the third one there is half of the diyah. They refused to accept that, so they went to the Prophet (ﷺ) when he was at Maqam Ibraheem and told him the story, and he said: “I will judge between you.” One of the people said: `Ali has already passed judgement. They told him about it and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) approved it.\nIt was narrated from Hanash that `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: The fourth one gets the diyah (blood money] in full."

I am a man who was attached to Quraish but I was one of them. The Muhajireen who are with you have relatives who will protect their families in Makkah, and I wanted, as i have no blood ties among them, to do them a favour so that they would protect my family. I did not do it out of kufr or because I apostatized from my religion, or because I approved of Kufr after becoming Muslim.

I felt that if I had wanted to, I could have reached the edge of the sky. I climbed up onto the top of the House, where there was a statue of brass or copper. I started shaking it right and left, forwards and backwards until, when I had managed to loosen it, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said to me: “Throw it down.” I threw it down and it broke like a glass bottle, Then I came down and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and I ran and hid among the houses lest any of the people see us."

Al-`Abbas said, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I have grown old and my bones have grown weak, and I need more sustenance. If you see fit, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), to order such and such measure of food for me, then do so.

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “We will do that.” And the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) appointed me in charge of it and I divided it during his lifetime.

Then he would wait until the sun rose as high there, meaning in the east, as it is at the time of Zuhr there, meaning in the west; then he would pray four rak`ahs, and four before Zuhr when the sun passed the meridian, and four afterwards, and four before ‘Asr, He would separate each two rak’ahs with salams upon the angels who are close to Allah, the Prophets, the believers and the Muslims who follow them. `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: That is sixteen rak`ahs which the Prophet (ﷺ) offered as nafl prayers during the day, but there are very few who offer them regularly.

      "text": "It was narrated that `Ubaidullah bin ‘Iyad bin `Amr al-Qari said:\n`Abdullah bin Shaddad came and entered upon `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) when we were sitting with her, as he was returning from Iraq during the time when ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) was murdered. She said to him: O `Abdullah bin Shaddad, will you tell me the truth about what I am going to ask you? Tell me about these people whom ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) killed. He said: Why shouldn`t I tell you the truth? She said: Tell me about them. He said: When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) corresponded with Mu`awiyah and the two arbitrators gave their verdict, eight thousand of the pious rebelled against him and camped in a land called Haroora`, near Koofah. They criticised him and said: You have taken off a chemise that Allah caused you to wear and a title that Allah gave to you, then you went ahead and asked people to issue a decree concerning the religion of Allah. There is no ruling except the ruling of Allah, may He be exalted. When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) heard about their criticism of him and the reason why they had split from him, he told his caller not to admit anyone but those who had memorised the Qur`an. When the house was filled with people who had memorised the Qur`an, he called for a large Mushaf and put it front of him, and he started tapping it with his hand, saying: O Mushaf, tell the people. The people called out: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, how could you ask it? It is only ink and paper, but we could speak on the basis of what we understand from it. What do you want? He said: These companions of yours who rebelled, between me and them is the Book of Allah, and Allah says in His Book concerning a woman and a man: `If you fear a breach between them twain (the man and his wife), appoint (two) arbitrators, one from his family and the other from hers; if they both wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation.` [an-Nisa 4:35]. The ummah of Muhammad is more important with regard to life and sanctity than a woman and a man. They got angry with me when I wrote a document between me and Mu`awiyah and wrote `Ali bin Abi Talib [without adding the title Ameer al-Mu`mineen]. But Suhail bin `Amr came to us when we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at al-Hudaibiyah, when he made a peace deal with Quraish, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote, `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.` Suhail said: Do not write, In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He said: What should we write? He said: Write: `In Your Name, O Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Write `Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).` He [Suhail] said: If I knew that you were the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I would not have opposed you. So he wrote: This is what was agreed by Muhammad bin `Abdullah with Quraish. And Allah says in His Book: “Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day` [Al-Ahzab 33:21]. So `Ali sent `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه) to them and I went out with him until we reached the middle of their camp. Ibnul-Kawwa` stood up and addressed the people, saying: O bearers of the Qur`an, this is `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه). Whoever does not know him, I know of the Book of Allah what can tell you about him, He is one of those concerning whom the words `they are a quarrelsome people` [Az-Zukhruf 43:58] were revealed. Tell him to go back to the one who sent him and do not discuss the Book of Allah with him. Their spokesmen stood up and said: By Allah, we will discuss the Book of Allah. If he says something sound and true that we recognise we will follow him, and if he says something false we will reject his false argument. So they discussed the Book with ‘Abdullah for three days, and four thousand of them recanted and all of them repented, including Ibnul-Kawwa`. He took them to `Ali in Koofah, and `Ali sent word to the rest of them, saying: You know the turmoil between us and our opponents. Stay wherever you wish until the ummah of Muhammad (ﷺ) is united. The deal between us and you is that you should not shed any blood that it is forbidden to shed or commit acts of banditry on the roads or do wrong to any Non Muslim under Muslim protection. If you do that, we will declare war, for Allah does not love those who betray. `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) said: O Ibn Shaddad, did he kill them? He said: By Allah, no sooner had he sent this message to them but they committed acts of banditry, shed blood and regarded it as permissible to harm Ahludh-Dhimmah (non-Muslims living under Muslim protection). She said: Do you swear by Allah? He said: I swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other god that this is what happened. She said: I have heard that the people of Iraq are talking and saying dhuth-thuda, dhuth-thuda [i.e., the one with a deformed arm that looks like a breast]. He said: I saw him and I was with ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) when he was examining the slain. He called the people and said: Do you know this one? How many of them came and said: I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so, and I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so. And there was no proof of who he was except that. She said: What did `Ali say when he stood over him, as the people of Iraq claim? He said: I heard him say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. She said: Did you hear him say anything other than that? He said: No, by Allah. She said: Yes, Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. May Allah have mercy on `Ali (رضي الله عنه): it was his habit, if he saw something he liked, to say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. But the people of Iraq fabricated lies against him and added words to what he said."

And the sign of that is that there would be a black man among them who had a deformed arm: one of his arms would be like the breast of a woman, with a nipple like the nipple on a woman`s breast, around which are seven coarse hairs. Look for him, for I think he must be among them. So they looked for him and they found him on the bank of the river, lying beneath the slain. They brought him out and ’Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: Allahu Akbar! Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. He was holding an Arabian bow of his; he took it in his hand and started poking the man`s deformity with it and said: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. The people said Allahu Akbar when they saw that and they rejoiced and no longer felt upset."

They are the closest of the enemy to you, but if you go to your enemy, I am afraid that these people may attack what you leave behind.

They will recite the Qur`an, thinking that it is in their favour, but it will be against them; it will go no further than their throats. They will pass out of Islam as the arrow passes out of the prey. The sign of that is that among them will be a man who has an upper arm but no forearm, and on it will be something like the nipple of a breast, on which will be some white hairs.` If the army that fights them knew what reward they will have, as spoken on the lips of their Prophet (ﷺ), they would cease striving and rely on that.

If you delay this ‘Umrah so that you visit this House twice, that will be better, for Allah, may He be exalted, has bestowed a great deal of good. `Ali bin Abi Talib (رضي الله عنه) was at the bottom of the valley, seeding a camel of his.

It is for the one who needs it and for the one whose home is remote. Then he entered ihram for Hajj and `Umrah together. ‘Uthman (رضي الله عنه) turned to the people and said: Did I forbid it?

Whoever is close to the imam and is silent or listens, and does not engage in idle talk, will have a twofold reward. The one who is further away from the imam but is silent or listens, and does not engage in idle talk will have one reward. The one who is close to the imam but engages in idle talk and does not keep silent or listen will have a twofold burden of sin. The one who is further away from the imam and engages in idle talk and does not keep silent and listen will have one burden of sin. And the one who says, Be quiet, has spoken, and the one who speaks has no Jumu’ah. Then he said: This is what I heard from your Prophet (ﷺ) say."

Verily, my Salah (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of the ‘Alameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists). He has no partner, And of this I have been commanded, and I am one of the Muslims [Abun-Nadr said: and I am the first of the Muslims]. O Allah, there is no god but You. You are my Lord and I am Your slave. I have wronged myself and I admit my sin, so forgive me all my sins, for no one can forgive sins except You. Guide me to the best of conduct, for none can guide to that except You and divert from me bad conduct, for no one can divert it from me except You. Blessed and exalted are You, I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You.” When he bowed, he said: `O Allah, to You I have bowed, in You I have believed and to You I have submitted. My hearing my sight, my brain, my bones and my sinews submit to You.` When he rose from bowing he said: `Allah hears those who praise Him. Our Lord, to You be praise, filling the heavens, the earth and that which is between them and filling whatever else You will besides.” When he prostrated he said: “O Allah, to You I have prostrated, in You I have believed and to You I have submitted. My face has prostrated to the One Who created it, shaped it and gave it a good shape, and opened its hearing and sight. Blessed be Allah, the Best of creators.` Then he after said the salam at the end of the prayer: `O Allah, forgive me my past and future sins, what I have done in secret and what I have done openly, what I have transgressed and what You know more than I. You are the One Who brings forward and the One Who puts back, there is no god but You.`"

The people of the oasis caught a partridge and cooked it in water and salt, then they cut it into pieces to make thareed, and we offered it to `Uthman and his companions, but they refused to eat it. `Uthman (رضي الله عنه) said: It is game that I did not catch and I did not order it to be caught; it was caught by people who are not in ihram, and they have offered it to us, so there is nothing wrong with it. `Uthman said, Who can say something about this issue? They said: `Ali. So he sent for `Ali (رضي الله عنه), who came to him. `Abdullah bin Al-Harith said: It is as if I can see ‘Ali when he came, brushing some leaves off his hands. `Uthman (رضي الله عنه) said to him: Game that we did not catch and we did not order it to be caught; it was caught by people who are not in ihram and they offered it to us, so there is nothing wrong with it. ‘Ali got angry and said: I adjure any man who was present with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when the meat of an onager was brought and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “We are people who are in ihram; give it to people who are not in ihram.” Twelve of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) bore witness to that. Then `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: I adjure by Allah, any man who was present with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) when some ostrich eggs were brought and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `We are people who are in ihram; give them to people who are not in ihram.` Fewer than twelve men bore witness.

Verily, my Salah (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allah, the Lord of the Alameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists). He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims, O Allah, You are the Sovereign, there is no god but You. You are my Lord and I am Your slave. I have wronged myself and I admit my sin, so forgive me all my sins, for no one can forgive sins except You. O Allah, guide me to the best of conduct, for none can guide to that except You; divert from me the worst of conduct, for none can divert it except You. Here I am at Your service, all goodness is in Your hand and evil cannot be attributed to You. My existence is due to You and my return is to You. Blessed and exalted are You, I seek Your forgiveness and I repent to You.` When he bowed, he said: `O Allah, to You I have bowed, in You I have believed and to You I have submitted. My hearing, my sight, my brain, my bones and my sinews submit to You.` When he rose from bowing he said: “Allah hears the one who praises Him. O Allah our Lord, to You be praise, filling the heavens, filling the earth, filling that which is between them and filling whatever else You will besides.` When he prostrated he said: “O Allah, to You I have prostrated, in You I have believed and to You I have submitted. My face has prostrated to the One Who created it and gave it shape and gave it the best of shapes, and opened its hearing and sight, Blessed be Allah, the Best of creators.` When he had finished praying he said: `O Allah, forgive me my past and future sins, what I have done in secret and what I have done openly, what I have transgressed and what You know more than I. You are the One who brings forward and the One Who puts back, there is no god but You.` `Abdullah said: We heard from Ishaq bin Rahawaih, from an-Nadr bin Shumail, that he said concerning this hadeeth, instead of, `evil cannot be attributed to You,” he said: Evil cannot be used to draw close to You.\nIt was narrated from `Ali bin Abi Talib (رضي الله عنه), from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), that When he began to pray, he said takbeer, then he said, `I have turned my face.` - and he narrated a similar report, except that he said `and divert from me the worst of conduct.”\nA similar report was narrated from Al-A`raj, from `Ubaidullah bin Abi Rafi`, from `Ali bin Abi Talib (رضي الله عنه), from the Prophet (ﷺ)."

He said: What is it, may you be bereft of your father? He said. Something I heard `Ali (رضي الله عنه) say. He said: The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) sent me, az-Zubair and Abu Marthad on a mission, and we were all horsemen. He said: `Go to Rawdat Khakh, for there you will find a woman who has a letter with her from Hatib bin Abi Balta`ah to the mushrikeen; bring it to me.` So we went on our horses until we caught up with her where the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) had told us, travelling on a camel of hers. He [Hatib] had written to the people of Makkah, telling them about the march of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). We said to her. Where is the letter you have with you? She said: I do not have any letter. We made her camel kneel down and searched her luggage for it, but we did not find anything. My two companions said: We do not see any letter with her, I said: You know that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not tell a lie. Then I swore: By the One by whom oaths are sworn, you will give us the letter or we will remove your clothes. She stretched out her hand to her girdle, which was wrapped around her, and brought out the letter. I brought it to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and they said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he has betrayed Allah and His Messenger and the believers; let me strike his neck. He said: `O Hatib, what made you do what you did?` He said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), by Allah, it is not that I do not believe in Allah and His Messenger, but I wanted to do a favour for the people by means of which Allah might protect my family and my property, for every one of your Companions has some of his people there through whom Allah will protect his family and his property. He said: You have spoken the truth, do not say anything to him but good.` ʻUmar said: O, Messenger of Allah, he betrayed Allah and His Messenger and the believers, let me strike his neck. He said. `ls he not one of the people of Badr? How do you know? Perhaps Allah looked upon them and said. “Do what you like, for Paradise is guaranteed for you.ʻʼ ʻUmarʻs eyes filled with tears and he said: Allah, may He be exalted, and His Messenger know best."

He said: Some captives have been brought to your father, go and ask him for a servant. She said: And I, by Allah, have ground flour until my hands became sore. So she went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and he said: “What brings you here, O my daughter?” She said: I have come to greet you; and she felt too shy to ask him, so she went back, ‘Ali said: What happened? She said: I felt too shy to ask him. So we went together and I said: O Messenger of Allah, by Allah I have brought water until I started to feel pain in my chest. And Fatimah said: I have ground flour until my hands hurt. Allah has brought you plenty of captives, so give us a servant. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “By Allah, I will not give it to you and leave ahlus-suffah starving when I have nothing to spend on them. Rather I will sell them (the captives) and spend the price on (ahlus-suffah).” So they went back. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) came, when they were under the cover which, if it covered their heads, it left their feet bare, and if it covered their feet, it left their heads bare. They wanted to get up, but he said: `Stay where you are.` And then he said: `Shall I not tell you of something that is better than what you asked for?” They said: Yes. He said: `(It is) words that Jibreel (عليه السلام) taught me.` He said: “Following every prayer, glorify Allah ten times, and praise Him ten times and magnify Him ten times. And when you go to your bed, glorify Allah thirty-three times, praise Him thirty-three times and magniÍy Him thirty-four times.” He said: By Allah, I never omitted that from the time the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) taught it to me. Ibnul-Kawwa’ said to him: Not even on the night of Siffeen? He said: May Allah cause your doom, O people of Iraq! Yes, not even on the night of Siffeen."

      "text": "It was narrated that `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said:\nWhen we came to Madinah we ate from its fruits and did not feel comfortable in it, and we became ill. The Prophet (ﷺ) was trying to find out about the well of Badr, and when we heard that the mushrikeen had come, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) marched to Badr, and Badr was a well. We got there before the mushrikeen and we found two of their men, a man from Quraish and a freed slave of “Uqbah bin Abi Mu`ait. As for the Qurashi, he managed to escape, but we caught the freed slave of ‘Uqbah and started asking him: How many are the people? He said: By Allah, they are great in number and powerful. When he said that, the Muslims began to beat him and they brought him to the Prophet (ﷺ), who said: How many are the people? He said: By Allah, they are great in number and powerful. The Prophet (ﷺ) tried hard to make him tell him how many they were, but he refused. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) asked him: How many camels do they slaughter? He said: Ten each day. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: They are one thousand; each camel is for one hundred men. Then a shower of rain fell on us at night and we rushed to seek shelter beneath the trees and leather shields, sheltering from the rain. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) spent the night calling upon his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, saying: “O Allah, if You cause this band to be destroyed, You will never be worshipped.” When dawn came, he called out: `Prayer, O slaves of Allah!” And the people came from beneath the trees and shields and the Messenger of Allah led us in prayer and encouraged us to fight. Then he said: `The army of Quraish is beneath this red outcrop of the mountain.` When the people drew close to us, and we stood in ranks facing one another, we saw one of their men, riding a red camel of his, going around among the people. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `O `Ali, call Hamzah for me` - as he was the closest of them to the mushrikeen - and said `Who is the one on the red camel and what is he saying to them?` Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `If there is anyone among the people who is enjoining good, then perhaps it is the one on the red camel.` Hamzah came and said: He is `Utbah bin Rabee`ah, and he is telling them not to fight; he is saying to them: O people, I can see people who are going to fight to the death and you will never be able to harm them, because it will cost you too dear to do so. O people, put the blame on me and say: `Utbah bin Rabee`ah is a coward, although you know that I am not the most cowardly among you. Abu Jahl heard that and said: Are you saying this? By Allah, if anyone else said this I would have insulted him; you are filled with fear, ‘Utbah said: Do you mean me, O you with the whistling rear end (i.e., one who breaks wind a great deal because of fear)? Today you will know which of us is the coward. Then ‘Utbah and his brother Shaibah and his son al-Waleed stepped forward in a display of courage and said: Who will come out to fight in single combat? Six young men of the Ansar stepped forward, but `Utbah said: We do not want these; let some of our cousins of Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib come out. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Get up, O Ali, get up, O Hamzah, get up, O `Ubaidah bin al-Harith bin ‘Abdul-Muttalib.` Allah caused `Utbah and Shaibah, the two sons of Rabee`ah, and al-Waleed bin ‘Utbah to be killed and ‘Ubaidah was wounded. We killed seventy of them and captured seventy. A short Ansari man brought al-Abbas bin `Abdul-Muttalib as a captive, and al-`Abbas said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), by Allah, this is not the one who captured me; I was captured by a bold man who was one of the most handsome of people, who was riding a piebald horse, but I do not see him among the people. The Ansari said: I captured him, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: `Be quiet! Allah, may He be exalted, supported you with a noble angel.` `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: We took prisoners, and from among Banu `Abdul-Muttalib, we captured al-`Abbas, ‘Aqeel and Nawfal bin al-Harith."

Hamzah bin Abdul-Muttalib was drinking in that house. Hamzah attacked them with his sword, cutting off their humps and cutting open their flanks, then he took out their livers. I said to Ibn Shihab. Did he take out anything from their humps? He said: He cut off their humps and took them away. `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: I looked at a sight that shocked me. I went to the Prophet (ﷺ), and Zaid bin Harithah was with him, and I told him what had happened. He went out, accompanied by Zaid, and I went with him. He entered upon Hamzah and expressed his anger to him. Hamzah looked up and said: Are you anything more than the slaves of my father? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) backed off until he departed from them. That was before the prohibition on alcohol."

Come and I will judge between you, if you accept it (all well and good), otherwise refer the matter to the Prophet (ﷺ).” He ruled that one quarter of the diyah should be given for the first one, one third of the diyah for the second one, half of the diyah for the third one and the complete diyah for the fourth one. Some of them accepted it and some of them did not like it. And he imposed the diyah on the tribes of the people who had crowded one another in that place. So they referred the matter to the Prophet (ﷺ). Bahz said: Hammad said: I think he said: He was reclining, then he sat up and said: “I shall judge between you.” Then he was told that ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) had issued such and such a verdict, and he approved of it, `Affan said: `I shall judge between you.”"

Do you know how to express gratitude when you have finished eating?” I said: “What is gratitude for it?” He said: “To say: Praise be to Allah Who has fed us and given us to drink.” Then he said: “Shall I not tell you about me and Fatimah (رضي الله عنها)? She was the daughter of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and she was one of the dearest of his family to him, and she was my wife. She worked with the millstone until the millstone left marks on her hand, and she brought water with a bucket until the bucket left marks on her chest. She took care of the house until her garment became dusty and she lit a fire under the pot until her garment became dirty, and she suffered hardship because of that. Some female captives (or servants) were brought to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and I said to her: “Go to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and ask him for a servant to relieve you of the hardship you are in.” So she went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and she found some servants with him. Then she came back and did not ask him for one. (And he narrated the hadeeth - And he [the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)] said: `Shall I not tell you of something that is better for you than a servant? When you go to your bed, glorify Allah thirty three times, praise Him thirty three times, and magnify Him thirty four times.” She stuck her head out and said: “I am content with Allah and His Messenger,” twice. (And he narrated a hadeeth like that of Ibn ‘Ulayyah from al-Jurairi or similar to it.)"

He carried on until he came to the Jamrah. He stoned it, then he came to the place of sacrifice and said: “This is the place of sacrifice and all of Mina is a place of sacrifice.` Then a young woman of Khath`am came to him and said: My father is an old man and has become senile; he has lived until Allah made Hajj obligatory.

He said: `I saw a young man and a young woman and I was afraid that the Shaitan [might tempt] them.` A man came to him and said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I did tawaful-ifadah before shaving my head. He said: `Go ahead and shave your head or cut your hair, there is no problem.” And he came to Zamzam and said: `O Banu `Abdul-Muttalib, it is your right to draw water for pilgrims.

But what is the story about this document?” He said: “I came to Madinah with my father when I was a young boy, with some camels of ours to sell. My father was a friend of Talhah bin `Ubaidullah at-Taimi, so we stayed with him. My father said to him: “Come out with me and sell these camels of mine for me.” Talhah said: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has forbidden townsmen to sell for Bedouins. But I will go out with you and sit with you. Offer your camels for sale and if a man comes and makes you an offer and I think he is honest and sincere, I will tell you to sell to him. So we went out to the marketplace and showed the mounts that we had for sale, and Talhah sat nearby. People made offers to us, then when a man offered what we wanted, my father said to Talhah: “Shall I sell to him?” He said: “Yes, I am sure he is honest. So sell to him.” So we sold to him. Then when we took our money and ended our business, my father said to Talhah: “Ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) for a document for us, stating that no one should transgress against us with regard to our zakah.” (Talhah) said: “This is your right and it is the right of every Muslim.” He said: “Nevertheless, I would like to have a document from the Messenger of Allah(ﷺ).” So he took us out and brought us to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and said: “O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), this man is a man of the desert and is a friend of ours. He would like you to write a document for him, stating that no one should transgress against him with regard to his zakah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `That is his right and it is the right of every Muslim.” He said: “O, Messenger of Allah, he would like to have something from you in writing concerning that.” So the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote this document for us.”"

She shoved me in the chest, and she was a tough woman.” She said: “Stay away from me, may you have no land!” I said: “The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) is urging you (not to go and see them).” She stopped and took out two pieces of cloth that she had with her and said: “These are two pieces of cloth that I have brought for my brother Hamzah. I have heard that he has been killed; shroud him with them.” We brought the two pieces of cloth to shroud Hamzah with them, but we saw beside him one of the Ansar who had been killed, and the same had been done to him as to Hamzah. We did not feel it was appropriate to shroud Hamzah in two pieces of cloth and to leave the Ansari with no shroud, so we said: “One piece for Hamzah and one piece for the Ansari.” We measured (the pieces of cloth) and found that one of them was larger, so we drew lots between them and shrouded each of them in the piece of cloth that was selected for him."

The Prophet (ﷺ) said to az-Zubair (رضي الله عنه): `Water (your trees), then let the water flow to your neighbour.` The Ansari got angry and said: “O Messenger of Allah, it is because he is your cousin!” The face of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) changed colour, then he said to az-Zubair: “Water (your trees), then block the water until it backs up to the bottom of the wall.” So the Prophet (ﷺ) told az-Zubair (رضي الله عنه) to take all of his rights in full. Before that, the Prophet (ﷺ) had suggested to az-Zubair (رضي الله عنه) something that would be good for both him and the Ansari, but when the Ansari annoyed the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), he told az-Zubair to take his rights in full in a clear ruling. `Urwah said: “az-Zubair (رضي الله عنه) said: By Allah, I think that this verse was revealed concerning that: But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad (ﷺ)) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission` (an-Nisa` [4:65]).”"
