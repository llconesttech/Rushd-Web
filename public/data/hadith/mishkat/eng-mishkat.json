He said, “Now tell me about faith.” He replied, “It means that you should believe in God, His angels, His books, His apostles, and the last day, and that you should believe in the decreeing both of good and evil.\" Remarking that he had spoken the truth, he then said, “Now tell me about doing good.\" He replied, “It means that you should worship God as though you saw Him, for He sees you though you do not see Him.\" He said, “Now tell me about the Hour.\" He replied, “The one who is asked about it is no better informed than the one who is asking.\" He said, “Then tell me about its signs.\" He replied, “That a maid-servant should beget her mistress, and that you should see barefooted, naked, poor men and shepherds exalting themselves in buildings.\" [‘Umar] said: He then went away, and after I had waited for a long time [the Prophet] said to me, “Do you know who the questioner was, ‘Umar?\" I replied, “God and His messenger know best.\" He said, “He was Gabriel who came to you to teach you your religion.\"\nMuslim transmitted it."

God’s messenger said, “Five times of prayer each day and night.” He asked, “Must I observe any more than them?” He replied, “No, unless you do it voluntarily.” God's messenger said, “And fasting during the month of Ramadan.” He asked, “Must I observe anything else?” He replied, “No, unless you do it voluntarily.” Talha said that God's messenger mentioned the zakat to him, and he asked, “Must I pay anything else?” He replied, “No, unless you do it voluntarily.” He said that the man turned away saying, “I swear by God that I shall not add anything to this or fall short of it.” So God’s messenger said, “The man will prosper if he is speaking the truth.”\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

Seeing a rabi’ (i.e. a streamlet) flowing into the garden from a well outside, I drew myself together and went in to where God's messenger was. He said, “Is it Abu Huraira?\" I replied, “Yes, messenger of God.\" He said, “What do you want?\" I replied, “You were among us, but got up and went away and delayed for a time, so fearing that you might be attacked by some enemy when we were not with you, we became alarmed. I was the first to be alarmed, so when I came to this garden I drew myself together as a fox does; and these people are following me.\" Addressing me by name he gave me his sandals and said, “Take away these sandals of mine, and when you meet anyone outside this garden who testifies that there is no god but God, being assured of it in his heart, gladden him by announcing that he will go to paradise.\" Now the first one I met was ‘Umar. He asked, “What are these sandals, Abu Huraira?” and I replied, “These are God’s messenger’s sandals with which he has sent me to gladden anyone I met who testified that there is no god but God, being assured of it in his heart, with the announcement that he would go to paradise.” Thereupon ‘Umar struck me on the breast and I fell down on my seat.” He then said, “Go back, Abu Huraira”; so I went back to God’s messenger, and I was ready to weep. ‘Umar followed me closely, and there he was behind me. God’s messenger said, “What is the matter with you, Abu Huraira?” I replied, “I met ‘Umar and conveyed to him your message, whereupon he gave me a blow on the breast which made me fall down on my seat and ordered me to go back.” God’s messenger said, “What induced you, ‘Umar, to do what you did?” He replied, “Messenger of God, for whom I would give my father and mother as ransom, did you send Abu Huraira with your sandals to gladden anyone he met who testified that there is no god but God, being assured of it in his heart, with the announcement that he would go to paradise?” He said, “Yes.” ‘Umar said, “You must not do it, for I am afraid that people will trust in it alone; let them go on doing [good] works.” God’s messenger said, “Well let them.”\nMuslim transmitted it."

He then made an agreement and covenant with them, calling them to witness regarding themselves, [saying] “Am I not your Lord?” They replied, “Yes.” He said, “I call the seven heavens and the seven earths to witness regarding you, and I call your father Adam to witness regarding you, lest you should say on the day of resurrection, ‘We did not know of this.’ Know that there is no god other than me and no lord other than me, and do not associate anything with me. I shall send to you my messengers to call to your remembrance my agreement and my covenant, and I shall send down my books to you. They replied, “We testify that Thou art our Lord and our God; we have no other lord and no other god but Thee.” So they confirmed that. Adam was raised above them and looked at them, and seeing the rich and the poor, the beautiful and those not so beautiful, he asked, “My Lord, why didst Thou not make Thy servants equal?” He replied, “I wanted to be thanked.” He also saw among them the prophets like lamps with light in them. They had another -special covenant concerning their mission and prophetic office, viz. His words, “And when we took from the prophets their covenant...

A man replied that he did, and on being asked when they died said it was in the period when the people were polytheists.

God’s messenger showed signs of anger on\nhis face because of the poverty-stricken state in which he saw them,\nand went in. After a little he came out and gave orders to Bilal who\nuttered the call to prayer and announced that the time to begin prayer\nhad come. When the Prophet had prayed, he delivered an address in\nwhich he said, “ ‘Fear your Lord, people, who created you from one\nsoul . . . God watches over you.’[Qur’an, iv, 1] ‘Fear God, and let a soul look to\nwhat it has sent forward for the morrow. [Ibid., lix, 18] Let a man give sadaqa\nfrom his dinars and dirhams, his clothing, his sa‘ of wheat and sa‘ of\ndates, even if it is only half a date.” Jarir said: One of the Ansar\nbrought a purse which was almost too big for his hand to hold, indeed\nit was too big. Then people came one after the other till I saw two\nmounds of food and clothing, with the result that I saw the face of God’s\nmessenger glowing as if it were golden. He then said, “If anyone establishes a good sunna in Islam he will have a reward for it and the\nequivalent of the rewards of those who act upon it after him, without\ntheirs being diminished in any respect; but he who establishes a bad\nsunna in Islam will bear the responsibility of it and the responsibility\nof those who act upon it after him, without theirs being diminished in\nany respect.” Muslim transmitted it.\n*[The text has an-nimar au al-'aba, thus giving an alternative word.

He then washed his face three times, then washed each arm twice up to the elbows, then wiped his head both front and back with his hands, beginning with the front of the head and moving them to the nape of the neck, then bringing them back to the place from which he began. He then washed his feet. Malik and Nasa’i transmitted it, and Abu Dawud has something similar. The author of the Jami‘ mentioned it. In the version of Bukhari and Muslim ‘Abdallah b. Zaid b. ‘Asim was asked to perform ablution for them as God's messenger had done, so he called for a vessel and, pouring water from it on his hands, he washed them three times, then inserted his hand and brought it out, rinsed his mouth and snuffed up water from the palm of one hand, doing that three times. He then inserted his hand and brought it out and washed his face three times, then inserted his hand and brought it out and washed each arm up to the elbows twice, then inserted his hand and brought it out and wiped his head both front and back with his hands. He then washed his feet up to the ankles and said, “This is how God’s messenger performed ablution.” A version says that he moved them to the front and the back beginning with the front of his head, then moving them to the nape of his neck, then bringing them back till he reached the place from which he had begun, after which he washed his feet. Another version says that he rinsed his mouth, snuffed up water and cleared his nose three times with three handfuls of water. Another version says that he rinsed his mouth and snuffed up water from one palm, doing that three times. In a version by Bukhari he wiped his head front and back with both hands once, then washed his feet up to the ankles.

Shu'ba, telling that he had gone with God’s messenger on the expedition to Tabuk, said:\nGod’s messenger relieved himself beside some low ground before the morning prayer, and I went with him carrying a small water-skin. When he came back I began to pour water from the skin over his hands, and he washed his hands and face. He was wearing a long-sleeved woollen gown, and tried to get his forearms out, but the sleeve of the gown was too narrow, so he brought his hands out from under the gown, and throwing it over his shoulders, he washed his forearms. Then he wiped his forelock and over his turban. I was then about to remove his shoes when he said, “Leave them, for my feet were pure when I put them in”; so he rubbed over them, and he and I mounted our beasts and came to the people. They had begun the prayer with ‘Abd ar-Rahman b. ‘Auf leading them, and he had performed a rak'a with them, but when he was aware of the Prophet’s presence he began to retire. The Prophet, however, signed to him to continue and performed one of the rak'as along with him. Then when he had pronounced the salutation the Prophet got up, and I got up along with him, and we performed the rak‘a which had been finished before we came.\nMuslim transmitted it."

He then said that he would tell them how the practice of bathing on Friday began. The people were in difficult circumstances, their clothing being of wool and their work being the carrying of loads on their backs. Their mosques was rather small and had a low roof which was only made of trellis work. God’s messenger came out one hot day when the people were sweating in their woollen garments to such an extent that they annoyed one another by the odours which were spread around. When God’s messenger noticed those odours he said, “When this day comes, you people must wash, and each of you should apply the best grease and perfume you can find.” Ibn ‘Abbas added that when God afterwards brought prosperity, they wore clothes not made of wool, they did not need to do manual labour, their mosque was extended, and some of the annoyance caused to one another by the sweat came to an end.\nAbu Dawud transmitted it."

She found him in the house of her sister Zainab daughter of Jahsh and said, “Messenger of God, I menstruate to a great extent, and it is severe, so what command do you give me about it? It has prevented me from praying and fasting.” He said, “I suggest that you use cotton, for it removes the blood.” She replied, “It is too copious for that.” He said, “Then stop it with a tight rag.” She replied, “It is too copious for that.” He said, “Then take a cloth.” She replied, “It is too copious for that, for my blood keeps flowing.” So the Prophet said, “I shall give you two commands; whichever of them you follow, it will make the other unnecessary, but you will know best whether you are strong enough to follow both of them This is a stroke of the devil, so observe your menses for six or seven days, God alone knowing which it should be, then wash, and when you see that you are purified and quite clean pray during twenty-three or twenty-four days and nights and fast, for that will be enough for you, and do so every month, just as women menstruate and are purified at the time of their menstruation and their purification. But if you are strong enough to delay the noon prayer and advance the afternoon prayer, then wash and combine the noon and the afternoon prayer; to delay the sunset prayer and advance the night prayer, then wash and combine the two prayers, do so; and to wash at drawn, do so; and fast if you are able.” God’s messenger said, “This is the one which is more attractive to me.”\nAhmad, Abu Dawud and Tirmidhi transmitted it."

He told Bilal to remain on guard during the night, and he prayed as much as he could while God’s Messenger and his companions slept. When the time for dawn approached Bilal leaned on his camel facing in the direction from which the dawn should appear; but he was overcome by sleep while he was leaning on his camel, and neither God’s Messenger nor Bilal awoke, nor did any of his companions till the sun shone on them. God's Messenger was the first of them to awake, and being startled he called to Bilal, who said \"He who took away my soul is the One who took away yours.\"2 He said, \"Lead the beasts on,” and when they had done so for some distance, God’s Messenger performed ablution, gave orders to Bilal who pronounced the iqama, and then led them in the Morning Prayer. When he finished the prayer he said, \"If anyone forgets prayer he should say it when he remembers it, for God has said, ‘And observe the prayer for remembrance of me.’”3\n1. In 7 AH.\n2.

The people were startled when they awoke, and God’s Messenger ordered them to mount and get out of that wadi, saying, \"This is a wadi inhabited by a devil.” So they mounted, and when they had gone out of that wadi God’s Messenger ordered them to dismount and perform ablution, and having ordered Bilal to summon the people to prayer, or pronounce the iqama, he led the people in prayer and afterwards departed. He had noticed some of their dismay, so he said, \"You people must realise that God took our spirits, and if He had wished He would have returned them to us at another time than this; so if anyone of you sleeps beyond the time for prayer, or forgets it, then has recourse to it, he should observe it as he has been in the habit of doing at its proper time.” God’s Messenger then turned to Abu Bakr as-Siddiq and said, “The devil came to Bilal while he was standing engaged in prayer, and making him lie down, he kept soothing him as a child is soothed till he fell asleep.” He then summoned Bilal who told him something similar to what he had just told Abu Bakr, whereupon Abu Bakr said. “I testify that you are God’s Messenger.”\nMalik transmitted it in mursal form."

At the end of two rak'as he stood up and said the takbir, raising his hands so as to bring them opposite his shoulders in the way he had said the takbir on beginning to pray; then he did that in the remainder of his prayer, and after the sajda* which is followed by the taslim he put out his left foot and sat on his left hip; then he uttered the taslim. They said, “You have spoken the truth. This is how he used to pray.”\n*i.e. prostration\nAbu Dawud and Darimi transmitted it. And Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah transmitted something to the same effect. Tirmidhi saying that this is a hasan sahih tradition.\nThen he bowed and placed his hands on his knees as though he were clutching them, and he bent his arms and kept them away from his sides. He (i.e. the narrator) said that he then prostrated himself placing his nose and his forehead on the ground, keeping his arms away from his sides, placing the palms of his hands [on the ground] opposite his shoulders, keeping his thighs separate and not letting his stomach press on any part of his thighs till he finished; then he sat up and spread out his left foot, putting forward the front of his right foot towards his qibla, placing the palm of his right hand on his right knee and the palm of his left hand on his left knee, and he pointed with his finger, i.e., his forefinger. In another version by him [it says]: When he sat at the end of two rak'as he sat on the sole of his left foot and raised the right, and after the fourth he placed his left hip on the ground and put out both feet on one side.\nA version by Abu Dawud of the tradition of Abu Humaid."

When he says the takbir and bows, say it and bow, for the imam bows before you and raises himself before you. Then God’s Messenger said, “The one is equivalent to the other.”* And he said: If you say, “O God our Lord, to Thee be the praise,” when he says, “God listens to him who praises him,” God will listen to you.\n* Although the imam begins and ends his bowing before you do, your bow lasts the same length of time as his.\nMuslim transmitted it.

What do you mean by looking at me?” They began to strike their hands on their thighs, and when I saw them urging me to be silent [I became angry],1 but I said nothing. When God’s Messenger finished his prayer (and I declare that neither before him nor after him have I seen a teacher who gave better instruction than he for whom I would give my father and mother as ransom), I swear by God that he did not scold, beat, or revile me, but said, “No talk to others is fitting during this prayer, for it consists only of glorifying God, declaring His greatness, and recitation of the Qur’an,” or words to that effect. I said, “Messenger of God, I have only recently been a pagan, but God has brought Islam to us, and among us there are men who have recourse to kahins.”2 He replied, “Do not have recourse to them.” I said, “Among us there are men who take omens.” He replied, “That is something which they find in their breasts, but let it not turn them away [from freedom of action]”. I said, “Among us there are men who draw lines.”3 He replied, “There was a prophet who drew lines, so if any do it as he did, that is allowable.”\n1. Some such phrase as that in brackets is required to complete the sense. It can be seen from the remarks at the end of the tradition that the text has been considered difficult.\n2. Diviners, soothsayers.\n3. The reference is to geomancy. The diviner draws many lines and obliterates them in pairs. If two are left it is a good sign, but if only one remains it indicates disappointment. The reference to the prophet may be a recollection of the statement in John 8:6 that Jesus wrote on the ground with his finger when the people asked what should be done with the woman caught in adultery; but this has no connection with geomancy.\nMuslim transmitted it. I found the phrase “But I said nothing” given thus in Muslim’s Sahih and al-Humaidi’s book. In Jami' al-usul it is stated to be correct, the word “thus”* being written above “but I.”\n*This corresponds to the use of (sic) to indicate an accurate quotation."

He then gave the salutation, then said “God is most great\" and made his usual prostration or one a little longer, then raised his head and said “God is most great\", then said “God is most great\" and made his usual prostration or one a little longer, then raised his head and said “God is most great\".

By their acceptance of Islam the Arabs were expecting victory for they would say ‘Let him and his people alone, for if be gets the better of them, he is a true prophet.’ Then when the battle of the conquest of Mecca took place every tribe hastened to accept Islam, and my father was the first of my tribe to accept it. When he returned he said: I swear by God that I have come to you from him who is truly the Prophet. He said, “Pray such and such a prayer at such and such a time, and such and such a prayer at such and such a time. When the time of prayer comes one of you should call the >i>adhan and the one of you who knows most of the Qur’an should act as your imam” So they considered, and there was no one who knew more of the Our’an than I did because of what I had received from the riders. They therefore put me forward in front of them, and I was only six or seven years old. I wore a mantle which, when I prostrated myself, went up on me, and a woman of the clan said, “Why do you not cover the backside of your reader from us?” So they bought and cut out a shirt for me, and I have never been so pleased about anything as I was about that shirt.\nBukhari transmitted it."

When he came round he asked whether the people had prayed and I told him they had not, but were waiting for him. The people were staying in the mosque waiting for the Prophet for the last evening prayer, so the Prophet sent instructions to Abu Bakr to lead the people in the prayer. When the Messenger came to him and told him God’s Messenger was ordering him to lead the people in the prayer, Abu Bakr, who was a sensitive man, told ‘Umar to lead the people, but when ‘Umar replied, “You are more entitled to that,” Abu Bakr led the prayers during those days. Afterwards the Prophet experienced some improvement in his condition and went out between two men, one of whom was al-‘Abbas, to the noon prayer when Abu Bakr was leading the people. When Abu Bakr saw him he began to withdraw, but the Prophet signed to him not to do so. He told his two companions to set him down beside Abu Bakr, and they did so and he remained seated. ‘Ubaidallah said that he visited ‘Abdallah b. ‘Abbas and asked if he might submit to him what ‘A’isha had told him about the illness of God’s Messenger, and he said, “Go ahead.” He submitted to him what she had told and he objected to none of it, only asking whether she had named to him the man who accompanied al- ‘Abbas.

He would use the toothstick, perform ablution, and pray nine rak'as, sitting only during the eighth of them, then he would make mention of God, praise and supplicate Him, then he would get up without uttering the salutation and pray the ninth. After that he would sit, make mention of God, praise and supplicate Him, then utter a salutation loud enough for me to hear. He would then pray two rak'as sitting after uttering the salutation, and that made eleven rak'as, sonny. But when God’s Messenger grew old and became fleshy he observed a witr of seven, doing in the two rak'as, as he had done formerly, and that made nine, sonny. When God’s prophet prayed a prayer he liked to keep on observing it, but when sleep or pain made it impossible for him to get up during the night; he prayed twelve rak'as during the day. I am not aware of God’s prophet having recited the whole Qur’an in a night, or praying through a whole night till morning, or fasting a complete month, except Ramadan.”\n*i.e. the good characteristics included in the Qur’an were shown by the Prophet in his own life.\nMuslim transmitted it."

You should pray four rak'as reciting in each one Fatihat al-Kitab (Al-Qur’an; 1) and a sura and when you finish the recitation in the first rak'a you should say fifteen times while standing, “Glory be to God. Praise be to God. There is no god but God. God is most great.” Then you should bow and say it ten times while bowing. Then you should raise your head after bowing and say it ten times. Then you should get down in prostration and say it ten times while prostrating yourself. Then you should raise your head after prostrating yourself and say it ten times. ’ Then you should prostrate yourself and say it ten times, then raise your head and say it ten times. That is, seventy-five times in every rak'a. You should do that in four rak'as. If you can observe it once daily do so; if not, then once weekly; if not, then once a month; if not, then once a year; if not, then once in your lifetime.\nAbu Dawud, Ibn Majah and Baihaqi, in [Kitab] ad-Da'awat al-kabir, transmitted it, and Tirmidhi transmitted something similar from Abu Rafi'."

While Bukhari, al-'amal fis salat, 8, gives a tradition which allows smoothing the ground once only, this tradition treats the matter as unsuitable. Regarding this tradition Lisan al-'Arab, 22:118, says that lagha means ‘he has spoken', or ‘deviated from what is right,‘ or ‘has been frustrated', adding that the first is the basic meaning. The idea is evidently that the one who makes a sound by removing small stones during the prayer has hindered someone from hearing. Cf. Qur'an, 41:26.\nMuslim transmitted it."

If he had cause to send out an expedition he mentioned it to the people, or if he required anything else he gave them commands about it, and he would say, “Give alms, give alms, give alms.\" Those who gave most were the women. Then he would go away. This practice went on till the time of Marwan b. al-Hakam.* I went out hand in hand with Marwan, and when we came to the place of prayer we saw that Kathir b. as Salt had built a pulpit of clay and brick. Marwan began to tug me with his hand as though he were pulling me towards the pulpit, while I was pulling him towards the prayer. When I saw what he was doing I said, “What has happened to the practice of beginning with prayer?\" He replied, “No, Abu Sa'id, what you are familiar with has been abandoned.\" I thereupon said three times, “By no means, by Him in whose hand my soul is, you are not doing something better than what I am familiar with.\" Then he went away.\n*Ummayyad Caliph, 64-65 A.H.\nMuslim transmitted it."

Samura, and the same occurs in Sharh as-sunna, on his authority, but in the copies of al-Masabih it is given on the authority of Jabir b. Samura."

In a version by Nasa’i it says that when the sun was eclipsed the Prophet prayed as Muslims normally do, bowing and prostrating himself. Another version by him says that when a solar eclipse took place one day the Prophet went out quickly to the mosque and prayed till it cleared. Then he said, “The people in pre-Islamic times used to say that the sun and moon were eclipsed only on account of the death of a great man, but the sun and moon are not eclipsed on account of anyone’s death or on account of his birth, but they are two of God’s creatures. God produces in His creation what He wills; so when either of them is eclipsed pray till it clears or till God produces something."

It had not yet been dug, so God’s messenger sat down and we sat down around him quietly. He had in his hand a stick with which he was making marks on the ground. Then he raised his head and said, “Seek refuge in God from the punishment of the grave saying it twice or thrice. He then said, “When a believer is about to leave the world and go forward to the next world, angels with faces white as the sun come down to him from heaven with one of the shrouds of paradise and some of the perfume of paradise and sit away from him as far as the eye can see. Then the angel of death comes and sits at his head and says, 'Good soul, come out to forgiveness and acceptance from God.' It then comes out as a drop flows from a water-skin and he seizes it; and when he does so, they do not leave it in his hand for an instant, but take it and place it in that shroud and that perfume, and from it there comes forth a fragrance like that of the sweetest musk found on the face of the earth. They then take it up and do not bring it past a company of angels without their asking, “Who is this good soul?' to which they reply, ‘So and so, the son of so and so,’ using the best of his names by which people called him on the earth. They then bring him to the lowest heaven and ask that the gate should be opened for him. This is done, and from every heaven its archangels escort him to the next heaven till he is brought to the seventh heaven, and God who is great and glorious says, ‘Record the book of my servant in ‘Illiyun (Cf. Qur’an, lxxxiii, 18) and take him back to earth, for I created mankind from it, I shall return them into it, and from it I shall bring them forth another time.' His soul is then restored to his body, two angels come to him, and making him sit up say to him, ‘Who is your Lord?’ He replies, ‘My Lord is God.’ They ask, ‘What is your religion?’ and he replies, ‘My religion is Islam.’ They ask, ‘Who is this man who was sent among you?’ and he replies, ‘He is God’s messenger.’ They ask, ‘What is your [source of] knowledge?’ and he replies, ‘I have read God’s Book, believed in it and declared it to be true.’ Then one cries from heaven, ‘My servant has spoken the truth, so spread out carpets from paradise for him, clothe him from paradise, and open a gate for him into paradise.’ Then some of its joy and fragrance comes to him, his grave is made spacious for him as far as the eye can see, and a man with a beautiful face, beautiful garments and a sweet odour comes to him and says, ‘Rejoice in what pleases you for this is your day which you have been promised.' He asks, ‘Who are you, for your face is perfectly beautiful and brings good?” He replies, ‘I am your good deeds.’ He then says, ‘My Lord, bring the last hour; my Lord, bring the last hour, so that I may return to my people and my property.’ But when an infidel is about to leave the world and proceed to the next world, angels with black faces come down to him from heaven with hair-cloth and sit away from him as far as the eye can see. Then the angel of death comes and sits at his head and says, ‘Wicked soul, come out to displeasure from God.’ Then it becomes dissipated in his body, and he draws it out as a spit is drawn out from moistened wool. He then seizes it, and when he does so they do not leave it in his hand for an instant, but put it in that hair-cloth and from it there comes forth a stench like the most offensive stench of a corpse found on the face of the earth. They then take it up and do not bring it past a company of angels without their asking, ‘Who is this wicked soul?’ to which they reply, ‘So and so, the son of so and so,’ using the worst names he was called in the world. When he is brought to the lowest heaven request is made that the gate be opened for him, but it is not opened for him. (God’s messenger then recited, ‘The gates of heaven will not be opened for them and they will not enter paradise until a camel can pass through the eye of a needle.)(Qur'an, vii, 40) God who is great and glorious then says, ‘Record his book in Sijjin (Cf. Qur’an, Ixxxiii, 7 ff) in the lowest earth,’ and his soul is thrown down. (He then recited, ‘He who assigns partners to God is as if he had fallen down from heaven and been snatched up by birds, or made to fall by the wind in a place far distant.')(Qur’an, xxii, 31). His soul is then restored to his body, two angels come to him, and making him sit up say to him, ‘Who is your Lord?’. He replies, ‘Alas, alas, I do not know.’ They ask, ‘What is your religion?' and he replies, ‘Alas, alas, I do not know.’ They ask, ‘Who is this man who was sent among you?' and he replies, ‘Alas, alas, I do not know.’ Then one cries from heaven, ‘He has lied, so spread out carpets from hell for him, and open a gate for him into hell.’ Then some of its heat and hot air comes to him, his grave is made narrow for him so that his ribs are pressed together in it, and a man with an ugly, face, ugly garments and an offensive odour come to him and says, ‘Be grieved with what displeases you, for this is your day which you have been promised.’ He asks, ‘Who are you, for your face is most ugly and brings evil?' He replies, ‘I am your wicked deeds.’ He then says, ‘My Lord, do not bring the last hour.’ ” In a version there is something similar containing an addition: “When his soul comes out every angel between heaven and earth and every angel in heaven invoke blessings on him, and the gates of heaven are opened for him, no guardians of a gate failing to supplicate God that his soul may be taken up beyond them. But his soul, i.e., the infidel’s, is pulled out along with the veins and every angel between heaven and earth and every angel in heaven curse him, and the gates of heaven are locked, no guardians of a gate failing to supplicate God that his soul may not be taken up beyond them.\nAhmad transmitted it."

This is the obligatory sadaqa which God’s messenger imposed on the Muslims which God commanded him to impose. Those Muslims who are asked for the proper amount must give it, but those who are asked for more than that must not give it. For twenty-four camels or less, a sheep is to be given for every five. When they reach twenty-five to thirty-five, a she-camel in her second year is to be given. When they reach thirty-six to forty-five, a she-camel in her third year is to be given. When they reach forty-six to sixty, a she-camel in her fourth year which is ready to be covered by a stallion is to be given. When they reach sixty-one to seventy-five, a she-camel in her fifth year is to be given. When they reach seventy-six to ninety, two she-camels in their third year are to be given. When they reach ninety-one to a hundred and twenty, two she-camels in their fourth year which are ready to be covered by a stallion are to be given. When they exceed a hundred and twenty, a she-camel in her third year is to be given for every forty and a she-camel in her fourth year for every fifty. If anyone has only four camels, no sadaqa is payable on them unless their owner wishes, but when they reach five a sheep is payable on them. If anyone whose camels reach the number on which a she-camel in her fifth year is payable does not possess one but possesses one in her fourth year, that will be accepted from him along with two sheep if he can conveniently give them, or else twenty dirhams. If anyone whose camels reach the number on which a she-camel in her fourth year is payable does not possess one but possesses one in her fifth year, that will be accepted from him, and the collector must give him twenty dirhams or two sheep. If anyone whose camels reach the number on which a she-camel in her fourth year is payable possesses only one in her third year, that will be accepted from him along with two sheep or twenty dirhams. If any one whose camels reach the number on which a she-camel in her third year is payable possesses one in her fourth year, that will be accepted from him, and the collector must give him twenty dirhams or two sheep. If anyone whose camels reach the number on which a she-camel in her third year is payable does not possess one but possesses one in her second year, that will be accepted from him, and he must give along with it twenty dirhams or two sheep. If anyone whose camels reach the number on which a she-camel in her second year is payable does not possess one but possesses one in her third year, that will be accepted from him, and the collector must give him twenty dirhams or two sheep; but if he does not possess a she-camel in her second year as is required and possesses a male camel in its third year, that will be accepted from him and nothing extra is to be demanded along with it. Concerning the sadaqa on sheep which are pasturing, when they number from forty to a hundred and twenty, a sheep is to be given. On over a hundred and twenty up to two hundred two sheep are to be given. On over two hundred up to three hundred three sheep are to be given. If they exceed three hundred, a sheep is to be given for every hundred. If a man’s pasturing animals are one less than forty no sadaqa is due on them unless their owner wishes. An old sheep, one with a defect in the eye, or a male goat is not to be brought forth as sadaqa unless the collector is willing. Those which are in separate flocks are not to be brought together and those which are in one flock are not to be separated from fear of sadaqa. * Regarding what belongs to two partners, they can make claims for restitution from one another with equity. On dirhams a fortieth is payable, but if there are only a hundred and ninety nothing is payable unless their owner wishes.\nBukhari transmitted it.\n* The principle is that there is to be no rearrangement either so that the collector may get more than he might, or the owner may give less than he might."

If there are more, then up to three hundred three sheep are payable, and if there are more than three hundred a sheep is payable for every hundred.

Wear your lower garment halfway up to the knee, but if you dislike that, let it go down to the ankles; on no account, however, must you let it trail, for that is a kind of pride, and God does not like pride.

God has appointed the observance of fasting during it as an obligatory duty, and the passing of its night in prayer as a voluntary practice. If someone draws near to God during it with some good act he will be like one who fulfils an obligatory duty in another month, and he who fulfills an obligatory duty in it will be like one who fulfills seventy obligatory duties in another month. It is the month of endurance, and the reward of endurance is paradise. It is the month of sharing with others, and a month in which the believer’s provision is increased. If someone gives one who has been fasting something with which to break his fast it will provide forgiveness of his sins and save him from hell, and he will have a reward equal to his without his reward being diminished in any respect.” Some of them remarked to God’s messenger that they did not all have the means to give one who had been fasting something with which to break his fast, and he replied, “God gives this reward to him who gives one who has been fasting some milk mixed with water, or a date, or a drink of water with which to break his fast, and anyone who gives a full meal to one who has been fasting will be given a drink from any tank by God and will not thirst till he enters paradise. It is a month whose beginning is mercy, whose middle is forgiveness, and whose end is freedom from hell. If anyone makes things easy for his slave during it, God will forgive him and free him from hell.”"

God’s messenger then asked him whether he could get a slave to free, but he replied that he could not. He asked if he could fast two consecutive months, but he replied that he could not. He asked if he could provide food for sixty poor people, and when he replied that he could not, he told him to sit down. The Prophet then waited for a time, and meanwhile an ‘araq containing dates was brought to him, an ‘araq being a huge basket.* He asked where the man who had questioned him was, and when he replied, \"[Here] I am,\" he said, \"Take this and give it as sadaqa.\" The man replied, “Am I to give it to one who is poorer than I am, messenger of God? I swear by God that there is no poorer family than mine between the two lava plains of Medina,\" i.e. the two harras. The Prophet thereupon laughed so that his eye-teeth became visible and said, \"Give it to your family to eat.\"\n*In explaining the word 'araq the tradition calls it a hugh miktal. The miktal was a basket containing fifteen sa's. It is also said to have had double that capacity.\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

We seek refuge in God from the anger of God and His messenger.” ‘Umar kept on repeating these words till his anger calmed down, then asked, “Messenger of God, what is the position of one who observes a perpetual fast?” He replied, “May he not fast or break his fast!” or he said, “He has neither fasted nor broken his fast.” He asked, “What is the position of one who fasts two days out of every three?” and received the reply, “Is anyone able to do that?” He asked what was the position of one who fasted every second day and was told that was the fast David observed. He asked what was the position of one who fasted one day out of every three, and God’s messenger replied, “I wish I were given power to observe that.” Thereafter he said, “The observance of three days’ fast every month and of Ramadan every year is a perpetual fast. I seek from God that fasting on the day of ‘Arafa may atone for the sins of the preceding and the coming year, and I seek from God that fasting on the day of ‘Ashura’ may atone for the sins of the preceding year.”\nMuslim transmitted it."

Bukhari and Muslim agree on the subject-matter, the wording being Muslim's up to “and was told it is it the last ten”, the remainder being Bukhari's. In the version of ‘Abdallah b.

But when he said, “I am needy, have children dependent on me, and my need is great,” I let him go. In the morning the Prophet asked, “What happened to your prisoner last night, Abū Huraira?” and I replied, “Messenger of God, he complained of great need and of having children dependent on him, so I had pity on him and let him go.” He said, “He lied to you, and he will come back.” I realised that he would return because God’s messenger had told me so, and therefore I lay in wait for him. When he came and began to take up handfuls of the food, I seized him and told him I was certainly going to take him before God's messenger; but when he said, “Let me go, for I am needy with children dependent on me, and I shall not return” I had pity on him and let him go. In the morning God’s messenger asked me, “What has happened to your prisoner, Abū Huraira?” and I replied, “Messenger of God, he complained of great need and of having children dependent on him, so I had pity on him and let him go.” He said, “He has certainly lied to you, and he will come back,” so I lay in wait for him, and when he came and took up handfuls of food I seized him and said, “I am certainly going to take you before God’s messenger, for this is the third time you assert you will not return, and then you do.” He said, “If you let me go I will teach you some words by which God will benefit you. When you go to your bed recite the Throne Verse (Qur’ān 2:255), ‘God, there is no god but He, the Living, the Eternal’ to the end of the verse, for a guardian from God will then remain over you and no devil will come near you till the morning.” I therefore let him go, and in the morning God’s messenger asked me, “What has happened to your prisoner?” I replied, “He asserted that he would teach me some words by which God would benefit me.” He said, “He has certainly told you the truth though he is a great liar. Do you know to whom you have been talking for, three nights?” When I replied that I did not, he said, “That was a devil.”\nBukhārī transmit­ted it."

He asked if that was really so, and when I assured him that it was, he said he had heard God’s messenger say, “Dissension will certainly come,” and asked him how it could be avoided, to which he replied, “God’s Book is the way, for it contains information of what has happened before you, news of what will happen after you, and a decision regarding matters which occur among you (This is explained as a reference to such matters as unbelief and faith, obedience and dis-obedience, what is lawful and what is forbidden, etc.). It is the distinguisher and is not jesting, (Qur’ān, 86:13). If any overweening person abandons it God will break him, and if anyone seeks guidance elsewhere God will lead him astray. It is God’s strong cord, it is the wise reminder, it is the straight path, it is that by which the desires do not swerve nor the tongues become confused, and the learned cannot grasp it completely.* It does not become worn out by repetition and its wonders do not come to an end. It is that of which the jinn did not hesitate to say when they heard it, ‘We have heard a wonderful recital which guides to what is right, and we believe in it,’ (Qur’ān, 72). He who utters it speaks the truth, he who acts according to it is rewarded, he who pronounces judgment according to it is just, and he who invites people to it guides to a straight path.”\n*The verb used is one ordinarily meaning 'to be satisfied'. Here it is used to indicate that the learned can never learn all there is to be known about the teaching and meaning of the Qur’ān, so that they should be satisfied and feel no need to continue their study of it.\nTirmidhī and Dārimī transmit­ted it, Tirmidhī saying this is a tradition whose isnād is unknown, and al-Hārith is adversely criticised."

When the people separate they ascend up to heaven, and God who knows best asks them where they have come from. They reply, “We have come from Thy servants on the earth who are extolling and magnifying Thee, declaring Thy unity, praising Thee and making request of Thee.” He says, “For what are they asking me?” and they reply, “They are asking Thee for Thy paradise.” He asks whether they have seen His paradise, and when they reply, “No my Lord.” He asks how they would act if they had seen His paradise. They say, “They are also seeking Thy protection.” He asks, “From what are they seeking my protection?” and they reply, “From Thy fire.” He asks whether they have seen His fire, and when they reply that they have not, He asks how they would act if they had seen His fire. They say, “They are also asking Thy forgiveness,” to which He replies, “I have forgiven them, given them what they have asked for, and protected them from what they sought protection.” They say, “My Lord, so and so, a sinner, is among them, who just happening to pass by sat down with them.” He replies, “Him also I have forgiven. They are the people by reason of whom their associate will not be miserable.”"

He said, “Messenger of God, I passed by a thicket of trees in which I heard the chirping of young birds, so I took them and put them in my garment. Their mother came and flew round over my head, so I uncovered them to let her see them, and when she alighted on them I wrapped them all up in my garment, and these are what I have with me.” He gave command to put them down, and I did so,* but their mother would not leave them, whereupon God’s messenger said, “Do you wonder at the pity of the young birds’ mother for her young? By Him who sent me with the truth, God shows more pity towards His servants than the mother of young birds shows to her young. Take them back and put them where you got them, their mother being with them.” So he took them back.\n*The use of the first person seems strange here. The command was given to the man who was holding the bundle, and so one would have expected \"and he did so.\" This is not the kind of sentence in which the change of person frequently used in Arabic style seems natural.

      "text": "‘Abdallah b. ‘Amr b. al-‘As reported God’s messenger as saying there are two characteristics which will not be retained by any Muslim without his entering paradise. While they are easy, those who act upon them are few. One should say ‘Glory be to God’ ten times after every prayer, ‘Praise be to God’ ten times and ‘God is most great’ ten times. (He said he had seen God’s messenger counting them on his hand, and saying, “That is a hundred and fifty on the tongue, but one thousand five hundred in the scale”).[The three phrases each said ten times after the five times of prayer makes a hundred and fifty, and as a good deed gets a ten-fold reward the total is treated as one thousand five hundred.] When he goes to his bed he should say ‘Glory be to God,’ ‘God is most Great’ and ‘Praise be to God’ a hundred times, for that is a hundred on the tongue, but a thousand in the scale. He asked them which of them could commit two thousand five hundred sins in a day and a night.* He was asked how they could not retain these characteristics, and told them that the devil comes to a man while he is engaged in prayer, calling such and such and such and such to his memory until he turns away and perhaps may not do it. He also comes to him on his bed and keeps on making him sleep till he falls asleep.\n*The thousand plus the preceding fifteen hundred make two thousand five hundred good deeds with which the man who observes the two characteristics mentioned is credited, and as one could hardly commit as many sins in a day and a night there is a balance in his favour.\nTirmidhi, Abu Dawud and Nasa’i transmitted it. In Abu Dawud's version he said, “Two qualities or two characteristics will not be adhered to by a Muslim ...” And also in his version after saying “One thousand five hundred in the scale” he said, “When he goes to his bed he should say ‘God is most great’ thirty-four times, ‘Praise be to God’ thirty-three times and ‘Glory be to God’ thirty-three times.” In most texts of al-Masabih it is given on the authority of ‘Abdallah b. ‘Umar."

      "text": "Jabir b. ‘Abdallah said:\nGod’s messenger remained in Medina nine years, during which he had not performed the hajj, then made a public announcement in the tenth year to the effect that God’s messenger was about to perform the hajj. Large numbers came to Medina, and we went out with him. When we reached Dhul Hulaifa, Asma’ daughter of ‘Umais, gave birth to Muhammad b. Abu Bakr and sent to God’s messenger asking what she was to do. He replied, “Bathe, bandage your private parts with a cloth, and put on the ihram.” God’s messenger then prayed in the mosque, and after he had mounted al-Qaswa' and his she-camel stood erect with him on its back at al-Baida’, he raised his voice declaring God’s unity and saying, “Labbaik, O God, labbaik labbaik; Thou hast no partner; labbaik; praise and grace are Thine and the dominion; Thou hast no partner.” Jabir said : We did not express our intention of performing anything but the hajj, being unaware of the ‘umra [at that season], but when we came with him to the House he touched the corner and made seven circuits, running three of them and walking four. Then going forward to the station of Abraham, he recited, “And take the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.” (Qur’an 2:125)He then prayed two 'rak'as, having the station between him and the House. A version says that he recited in the two rak'as,. “Say, He is God, One,” and, “Say, O infidels.” (Qur’an 112, and 109) He then returned to the corner and touched it, after which he went out by the gate to as-Safa, on coming near to which he recited. “As-Safa and al-Marwa are among the signs appointed by God,” (Qur’an 2:158) adding, “I begin with what God began with.” So he went first to as-Safa, and mounting it till he could see the House, he faced the qibla, declared God's unity, proclaimed His greatness, and said, “There is no god but God alone who has no partner; to Him belongs the dominion, to Him praise is due, and He is omnipotent; there is no god but God alone who alone has fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and routed the confederates.\" He then made supplication in the course of that, saying such words three times. He next descended and walked towards al-Marwa, and when his feet came down into the bottom of the valley he ran, and when he began to ascend he walked till he reached al-Marwa. There he did as he had done at as-Safa, and when he came to al-Marwa for the last time, he called out, he being on al-Marwa and the people below him, saying, “If I had known before what I have come to know afterwards regarding my religion, I would not have brought sacrificial animals but made it an 'umra ; so if any of you has no sacrificial animals he,may take off the ihram and treat it as an ‘umra. Suraqa b. Malik b.Jush'um then got up and asked, “Messenger of God, does this apply to the present year, or does it apply for ever?\" God’s messenger intertwined his fingers and said twice, “The ‘umra has become incorporated in the hajj,\" adding “No, but for ever and ever.\" ‘Ali came from the Yemen with the Prophet’s sacrificial animals and he asked him what he had said when he undertook the duty of performing the hajj. He replied that he had said, “0 God, I am putting on the ihram for the same purpose as Thy messenger has put it on.\" He said, “I have with me the sacrificial animals, so do not put off the ihram.” [Jabir] said: The total of those sacrificial animals brought by ‘Ali from the Yemen and of those brought by the Prophet was a hundred. Then all the people, except the Prophet and those who had with them sacrificial animals, removed the ihram and clipped their hair. When yaum at-tarwiya (The 8th of Dhul Hijja, the day when pilgrims leave Mecca and go to Mina. The name is commonly explained as meaning that this was the day when the pilgrims provided themselves with a supply of water for the arid journey before them) came they went towards Mina having put on the ihram for the hajj, and the Prophet rode and prayed there the noon, afternoon, sunset, evening and dawn prayers. After that he waited a little till the sun rose, and gave orders for a tent of hair to be set up for him at Namira (A place or a hill near ‘Arafa). God’s messenger then set out, and Quraish did not doubt that he would observe a halt at the sacred site (At al-Muzdalifa, al-Mash'ar al-haram, a hill sacred to the god Ouzah in pre-lslamic times), as Quraish used to do in the pre-Islamic period ; but he passed on till he came to ‘Arafa and found that the tent had been set up for him at Namira. There he dismounted, and when the sun had passed the meridian he ordered al- Qaswa’ to be brought, and when it was saddled for him he went down into the valley and addressed the people, saying, “Your lives and your property must be respected by one another like the sacredness of this day of yours in this month of yours in this town of yours. Everything pertaining to the pre-Islamic period has been put under my feet, and claims for blood-vengeance belonging to the pre-lslamic period have been abolished. The first of those murdered among us whose blood-vengeance I remit is the son of Rabi'a b. al-Harith (Rabi’a was a grandson of 'Abd al-Muttalib. The name of the child who had been killed is variously given as Adam, Tammam and Iyas. Ibn ‘Abd al-Barr says Adam is a mistake, but does not commit himself to either of the other two names) who was suckled among the B. Sa'd and killed by Hudhail. The usury of the pre-Islamic period is abolished, and the first of our usury I abolish is that of ‘Abbas b. ‘Abd al-Muttalib, for it is all abolished. Show fear towards God regarding women, for you have got them under God’s security, and have the right to intercourse with them by God's word. They must not bring into your houses anyone whom you dislike, but if they do that beat them, though not severely. You are responsible for providing them with their food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you something, i.e. God’s Book, by which, if you hold to it, you will never again go astray. You will be asked about me, so what will you say?\" They replied, “We testify that you have conveyed and fulfilled the message and given counsel. ” Then raising his forefinger towards the sky and pointing it at the people, he said, “O God, be witness ; O God, be witness,” saying it three times. Bilal then uttered the call to prayer, and the iqama, and he prayed the noon prayer; he then uttered the iqama and he prayed the afternoon prayer, engaging in no prayer between the two. He then mounted his camel and came to the place of standing, making his she-camel al-Qaswa’ turn its back to the rocks and having the path taken by those who went on foot (The Arabic is Habl al-mushat, which is variously explained as above, or as ‘the concourse of horse on foot', or as the name of a place.) in front of him. He faced the qibla and remained standing till sunset when the yellow light had somewhat gone and the disc of the sun had disappeared. He took Usama up behind him and went quickly till he came to al-Muzdalifa, where he prayed the sunset and the evening prayer with one adhan and two iqamas without saying ‘Glory be to God' between them. He then lay down till dawn and prayed the dawn prayer with an adhan and an iqama when the morning light was clear. He then mounted al-Qaswa’ and when he came to the sacred site he faced the qibla, supplicated God, declared His greatness, His uniqueness and His unity, and kept standing till the daylight was very clear. He then went quickly before the sun rose, taking al-Fadl b. ‘Abbas behind him, and came to the valley of Muhassir (Between al-Muzdalifa and Mini). He urged the camel a little and following the middle road which comes out at the greatest jamra (Jamra, originally a pebble, is applied to a heap of stones, of which there are three in the valley of Mina. One of the rites of the hajj is to throw small stones at them), he came to the jamra which is beside the tree. At this he threw seven small pebbles (Literally, 'pebbles that are thrown’: used to indicate small pebbles about the size of a date-stone), saying “God is most great” each time he threw a pebble. He threw them from the bottom of the valley, then went to the place of sacrifice and sacrificed sixty-three victims with his own hand. Then he gave some to ‘Ali who sacrificed the remainder, and he shared with him in his sacrificial animals. After that he ordered that a piece of flesh from each victim should be put in a pot, and when it was cooked the two of them ate some of it and drank some of its broth. Then God’s messenger mounted, and going quickly to the House, prayed the noon prayer in Mecca. He came to the B. ‘Abd al-Muttalib who were supplying water at Zamzam and said, “Draw water, B. ‘Abd al-Muttalib. Were it not that people would take from you the right to draw water, I would draw it along with you.” So they handed him a bucket and he drank from it.\nMuslim transmitted it."

I had raised my voice in the talbiya only for an ’umra, but the Prophet ordered me to undo my hair, comb it, raise my voice in the talbiya for the hajj, and let the ‘umra go, which I did, and performed my hajj. He sent ‘Abd ar-Rahman b. Abu Bakr along with me and ordered me to make an ‘umra in place of the one I had missed from at-Tan‘im. She said: Those who had raised their voices in the talbiya for the ‘umra put off the ihram after making the circuit of the House and running between as-Safa and al-Marwa, then made a circuit after they returned from Mina, but those who combined the hajj and the ‘umra made only one circuit.\n(Bukharl and Muslim.)"

He first raised his voice in the talbiya for the ‘umra and afterwards he did so for the hajj, and the people along with the Prophet did it first for the ‘umra and afterwards for the hajj. Some of the people had brought sacrificial animals and others had not, so when the Prophet came to Mecca he said to the people, “Those of you who have brought sacrificial animals must not treat as lawful anything which has become unlawful for you till you complete your hajj ; but those of you who have not brought sacrificial animals should go round the House and between as-Safa and al-Marwa, clip your hair, put off the ihram, and afterwards raise your voice in the talbiya for the hajj and bring sacrificial animals. Those who cannot get sacrificial animals should fast three days during the hajj and seven days when they return to their families.” He performed the circumambulation when he came to Mecca, first touching the corner (The corner of the Ka'ba containing the Black Stone), then running during three circuits and walking during four, and when he had finished his circumambulation of the House he prayed two rak'as at the Station (Maqam Ibrahim), then giving the salutation, and departing, he went to as-Safa and went seven times between as-Safa and al-Marwa. After that he did not treat anything as lawful which had become unlawful for him till he had completed his hajj, sacrificed his animals on the day of sacrifice, gone quickly and performed the circumambulation of the House, after which all that had been unlawful became lawful for him. Those people who had brought sacrificial animals did as God’s messenger did.\n(Bukharl and Muslim.)"

As it was only five days before they were due at ‘Arafa, they said he had ordered them to go in to their wives and so they would come to ‘Arafa with their penises dripping with prostatic fluid. He said that Jabir made a gesture, moving his hand, and he could still imagine himself looking at him (Perhaps the gesture was meant to indicate that they could have shaken off the fluid). The Prophet then got up among them and said, “You know that I am the most godfearing, truthful and pious one among you. Were it not that I have sacrificial animals I would have removed the ihram as you are doing, and had I known beforehand about my affair what I have come to know later I would not have brought sacrificial animals ; so remove the ihram.'’ They did so, hearing and obeying. ‘Ata’ quoted Jabir as saying that ‘Ali arrived after his expedition to collect the poor rate and he asked him for what he had raised his voice in the talbiya. He replied that he had done it for the same purpose as the Prophet, so God's messenger said to him, “Bring the sacrificial animals and remain in the sacred state.” He said that ‘Ali brought sacrificial animals for him and that Suraqa b. Malik b. Jush'um asked God’s messenger whether this applied to that particular year or, forever, to which he replied that it was applicable forever.\nMuslim transmitted it."

      "text": "Abu Bakra said that the Prophet gave them the following sermon on the day of sacrifice:\n“Time has completed a cycle to the form of the day when God created the heavens and the earth. The year contains twelve months of which four are sacred, three of them consecutive, viz. Dhul Qa'da, Dhul Hijja. and Muharram, and also Rajab of Mudar which comes between Jumada and Sha'ban.”( The month Rajab is here connected with the North Arabian tribe of Mudar because they are said to have honoured it greatly and never to have broken its sacred nature. The precise reference to its place among the months is said’to be for the purpose of removing any doubt about it owing to the earlier practice of periodically intercalating a month) He asked, “What month is this?\" and when the people replied that God and His messenger knew best, he remained silent so that they thought he would give it a new name, but he said, “Is it not Dhul Hijja?\" and they replied that it was. He asked, “What town is this?\" and when the people replied that God and His apostle knew best, he remained silent so that they thought he would give it a new name, but he said, “Is it not al-Balda?”( This word occurs a number of times in the Qur’an in the general sense of a district, but in 27, 91 it is used particularly of Mecca which is there called “this district (balda)\". In the tradition the word seems to be used as if it were a proper name) and they replied that it was. He asked, “What day is this?” and when the people replied that God and His messenger knew best, he remained silent so that they thought he would give it a new name, but he said, “Is it not the day of sacrifice?\" and they replied that it was. He said, “Your lives, property and honour must be regarded by you with a sacredness like that of this day of yours in this town of yours in this month of yours. You will meet your Lord, and He will ask you about your deeds. O, do not revert after my death to being people who are astray, beheading one another. Have I delivered the message ?\" When they replied that he had he said, “O God, testify ; and let him who is present convey it to him who is absent, for many a one to whom a message is conveyed has a more retentive memory than the one who hears.”\nBukhari and Muslim."

Mulamasa means that a man touches another’s garment with his hand, whether at night or by day, without turning it over any more than that involves. Munabadha means that a man throws his garment to another and the other throws his garment, that confirming their contract without inspection or mutual agreement. One of the ways of dressing is the wrapping of the samma, which means that a man puts his garment over one of his shoulders so that one of his sides appears uncovered; the other is when a man wraps himself up in his garment while sitting in such a way that none of it covers his private parts.\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

Bai' al-gharar. One might translate this ‘aleatory contracts of sale’, but this is not the only term to which that applies. The type of transaction intended is one in which there is no guarantee that the seller can deliver the goods for which he receives payment. It could include such items as selling a runaway slave, or fish which one has not caught, etc."

He asked Rafi’ how the matter would stand if payment were made in dirhams and dinars and he replied that there would be no harm in that. It seemed that what was prohibited was such as people versed in what is allowed and what is prohibited would not permit if they looked into it, because of the risk involved*.\n* The objection to such an agreement is that one cannot guarantee beforehand what a particular piece of land will produce.\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

Peace, and God’s mercy and blessings be upon you, O Prophet. Peace be upon us and upon God’s upright servants. I testify that there is no god but God, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger.” The tashahhud in case of some need is, “Praise be to God from whom we ask help and pardon. We seek refuge in God from the evils within ourselves. He whom God guides if has no one who can lead him astray, and he whom He leads astray has no one to guide him. I testify that there is no god but God, and that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger.\" And one should recite three verses: “You who believe, fear God as He should be feared, and die only as Muslims;” (Al-Qur’an 3:102). “You who believe . . . fear God by whom you ask your mutual rights, and reverence the wombs. God has been watching over you;” (Al-Qur’an 4:1 which has ‘O Mankind.’). “You who believe, if you fear God and say what is true He will make your deeds sound and forgive you your sins. He who obeys God and His Messenger has attained a mighty success” (Al-Qur’an 33:70).\nAhmad, Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud, Nasa’i, Ibn Majah and Darimi transmitted it. In Tirmidhi’s Jami' Sufyan ath-Thauri gave a commentary on the three verses. Ibn Majah added “whom we praise” after “praise be to God”, and “from our evil actions” after “from the evils within ourselves.” After “mighty success” Darimi added that one should then express what he needs. In Sharh as-sunna it is transmitted on the authority of Ibn Mas’ud concerning the form of words for some need, whether marriage or something else."

Then this verse came down, “O prophet, say to your wives ... for those who do well among you a great reward” (Al-Qur’an 33:28 f). He then went first to ‘A’isha and said, “I want to propound something to you, ‘A’isha, but wish no hasty reply before you consult your parents.” When she had asked him what it was and he had recited the verse to her she said, “Shall I consult my parents about you, Messenger of God? Nay, I choose God, His Messenger, and the final abode; but I ask you not to tell any of your wives what I have said.” He replied, “Not one of them will ask me without my informing her.

May God send down something which will free my back from punishment!” Then Gabriel descended and brought down to him, “And those who make charges against their spouses,” reciting till he reached, “if he is one of those who speak the truth” (Al-Qur’an 24:6-9).Then Hilal came and gave testimony and the Prophet was saying, “God knows that one of you is lying. Will one of you repent?” Then the woman got up and testified, but when she was about to do it a fifth time they stopped her and told her that it would be the deciding one. Ibn ‘Abbas told that she then hesitated and drew back, so that they thought she would renounce what she had said; but thereafter she said, “I shall not disgrace my people forever,” and went on with her declaration. The Prophet told them to look and see whether she gave birth to a child with eyes looking as if they had antimony in them, wide buttocks and fat legs, for if she did, Sharik b. Sahma' would be its father. Then when she gave birth to a child of that description the Prophet said, “If it were not for what has already been stated in God’s Book, I would have dealt severely with her.”\nBukhari transmitted it."

Saying that she was due no maintenance, he ordered her to spend the period before she could remarry in the house of Umm Sharik, but said afterwards, “That is a woman whom my companions visit; spend the period in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum, for he is blind and you can undress. Then when you are in a position to be remarried, tell me.\" She said that when she was in a position to remarry she mentioned to him that Mu'awiya b. Abu Sufyan and Abu Jahm had asked her in marriage, and he replied, “As for Abu Jahm, he does not put down his stick from his shoulder, and as for Mu'awiya, he is a poor man who has no property; marry Usama b.

She had been divorced by her husband and they both claimed him. She addressed him in foreign speech telling him that her husband wished to take her son away, and Abu Huraira told them to cast lots for him, saying that to her in foreign speech. Then her husband came and asked who was disputing with him about his son, and Abu Huraira assured him in God's name that the only reason why he said what he had said was because once when he was sitting with God’s Messenger a woman came to him and said, “Messenger of God, my husband wants to take away my son, and he had benefited me and drawn water for me from the well of Abu ‘Inaba.” (Nasa’i has “from sweet water.”) God’s Messenger replied, “Cast lots for him.” Her husband asked, “Who is disputing with me about my son?” and God’s Messenger said, “This is your father and this is your mother, so take whichever of them you wish by the hand,” and he took his mother’s hand.\n* Mirqat, iii, 536 says that while Sulaiman appears in all texts of the Mishkat, the correct form is Salman.

A Muslim must not be killed for an infidel, nor must one who has been given a covenant be killed while his covenant holds.”\nAbu Dawud and Nasa’i transmitted it, and Ibn Majah transmitted it on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas.\n* The interpretation which seems to be preferred is that no matter how far one may live from the land of infidels, any protection one may guarantee to an infidel must be respected by all Muslims. Another possible explanation is that when a detachment is sent ahead into infidel country those who remain behind them are entitled to their portion of any spoil they take, but it is felt that this meaning does not suit the context. The Arabic words are wa-yaruddu 'alaihim aqsahum."

Meeting Abu Barza al-Aslami along with some of his companions on a festival day, I asked him whether he had heard God’s Messenger mentioning the Kharijites, and he replied that he had both heard him with his ears and seen him with his eyes. He told that God’s Messenger was brought some property and divided it, giving something to those on his right and those on his left, but giving nothing to those who were behind him. One of those behind him, a black man whose hair was completely cut off and who was wearing two white garments, then said, \"You have not divided justly, Muhammad.” God's Messenger became very angry and said, “I swear by God that after my death you will not find a man more just than I am,” adding, “At the end of time people looking like this man will come forth, reciting the Qur'an, but it will not pass their throats. They will swerve from Islam as an arrow passes through the game at which is it shot, and their distinguishing mark will be shaving. They will continue to come forth till the last of them comes forth with the antichrist. When you meet them they will be the worst of men and beasts.”\nNasa’i transmitted it."

Go back, ask God's forgiveness and turn to Him in repentance.” He said that he went back not very far, then came and said, “Purify me, Messenger of God,” and the Prophet said the same as he had said before. When this went on till a fourth time he asked, “For what am I to purify you?” and he replied that it was because of fornication. God’s Messenger then asked if the man was mad, and when he was told that he was not, he asked if he had drunk wine. A man got up and smelt his breath but noticed no smell of wine, so the Prophet asked him if he had committed fornication, and when he replied that he had, he gave orders regarding him and he was stoned to death. Two or three days later God’s Messenger came and said, “Ask forgiveness for Ma'iz b. Malik. He has repented to such an extent that if it were divided among a people it would be enough for them all.” Then a woman of Ghamid, a branch of Azd came to him and said, “Purify me, Messenger of God.” He replied, “Out upon you! Go back, ask God’s forgiveness and turn to Him in repentance.” She said, “Do you want to send me back as you did to Ma'iz b. Malik when I am 1 pregnant as a result of fornication?” He asked whether she was referring to herself, and when she replied that she was, he told her to wait till she had given birth to what was in her womb. One of the Ansar became responsible for her till she was delivered of a child, and then went to the Prophet and told him that the woman of Ghamid had given birth to a child. He said, \"In that case we shall not stone her and so leave her child as an infant with no one to suckle him.” One of the Ansar then got up and said, \"I shall be responsible for his suckling, Prophet of God.\" He then had her stoned to death. A version says that he told her to go away till she gave birth to a child, then when she did, he told her to go away and suckle him till she had weaned him. When she had weaned him she brought the boy to him with a piece of bread in his hand and said, \"I have weaned this one and he has eaten food.\" He (hen handed the boy over to one of the Muslims, and when he had given command regarding her and she was put in a hole up to her breast, he ordered the people to stone her. Khalid b. al-Walid came forward with a stone which he threw at her head, and when the blood spurted on his face he cursed her, but the Prophet said, \"Gently, Khalid, By Him in whose hand my soul is, she has repented to such an extent that if one who wrongfully takes an extra tax 2 were to repent to a like extent he would be forgiven.\" Then giving command regarding her, he prayed over her and she was buried.\nMuslim transmitted it.\n1. The Arabic uses the third person, saying she was pregnant. It may be an explanatory phrase, but I have ventured to treat it as part of the woman's word since this makes the sentence read a little more easily.\n2. Sahib maks. Maks was money taken from sellers in the market in pre-Islamic times; it is also used of something taken by a tax-collector over and above that is duo."

See p. 759) came to the Prophet and testified four times that he had had illicit intercourse with a woman, while he all the time was turning away from him. Then when he confessed a fifth time he turned round and asked if he had had intercourse with her, and when he replied that he had he asked if he had done it so that his member penetrated hers. He replied that he had, and he asked whether he had done it like a collyrium stick when enclosed in its case and a rope in a well. On his replying that it was so, he asked whether he knew what fornication was and he replied, “Yes, I have done with her unlawfully what a man may lawfully do with his wife.” He then asked what he wanted by what he had said and he replied that he wanted him to purify him, so he gave command and he was stoned to death. Then God’s prophet heard one of his companions saying to another, “Look at this man whose fault was concealed by God but who could not leave the matter alone, so that he was stoned like a dog.\" He said nothing to them but walked on for a time till he came to the corpse of an ass with its legs in the air. He then asked where so and so and so and so were, and when they replied that they were there he said, “Go down and eat some of this ass’s corpse.” They replied, “Prophet of God, who can eat any of this?” whereupon he said, “The dishonour you have just shown to your brother is more serious than eating some of it. By Him in whose hand my soul is, he is now among the rivers of paradise plunging into them.”\nAbu Dawud transmitted it."

I am supporting the B. so and so,” referring to one of the two parties. They then stopped, and when he asked what was the matter, they replied, “How can we shoot when you are supporting the B. so and so?” He said, “Shoot; I am supporting you all.”\n* Different explanations are given. It may be in the market-place (suq). Mirqat, iv, 202 is inclined to understand suq as the plural of saq (leg) and interpret it as meaning that they were on their feet, not riding camels. It has even been said that the reading is as-Sauq and that this is the name of a place; but I can find no reference to any such place. This all goes to show how difficult interpreters can make a passage seem when they let their imagination loose.\nBukhari transmitted it."

It is said that the sunna requires one who returns from a journey to provide such entertainment as is within his means. If the use of \"or” in the tradition does not indicate a doubt on the part of the transmitter as to which word is correct, but is a real alternative, this would justify the view that the tradition speaks of a practice of the Prophet. But the Arabic construction really suggests one occasion rather than any time the Prophet came back to Medina.\nBukhari transmitted it."

Uthal who was the chief of the people of al-Yamama and bound him to one of the pillars of the mosque. God’s Messenger came out to him and said, “What are you expecting, Thumama?” He replied, “I expect good, Muhammad. If you kill me you will kill one whose blood will be avenged, if you show favour you will show it to one who is grateful, and if you want property and ask you will be given as much of it as you wish.” God’s Messenger left him till the next day, and asked him, “What are you expecting, Thumama?” He replied, “I am expecting what I said to you. If you show favour you will show it to one who is grateful, if you kill me you will kill one whose blood will be avenged, and if you want property and ask you will be given as much of it as you wish.” God's Messenger left him till the following day, and asked him, “What are you expecting, Thumama?” He replied, “I am expecting what I said to you. If you show favour you will show it to one who is grateful, if you kill me you will kill one whose blood will be avenged, and if you want property and ask you will be given as much of it as you wish.” God’s Messenger then said, “Set Thumama free.” He went off to some palm-trees near the mosque, and after bathing he entered the mosque and said, “I testify that there is no god but God, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and Messenger. I swear by God, Muhammad, that there was no face on the face of the earth more hateful to me than yours, but your face has become the dearest of all to me. I swear by God that there was no religion more hateful to me than yours, but your religion has become the dearest of all to me. I swear by God that there was no town more hateful to me than yours, but your town has become the dearest of all to me. Your cavalry seized me when I was on my way to perform the umra, so what do you think I should do? God’s Messenger congratulated him and told him to perform the umra. When he came to Mecca someone asked him whether he had turned to folly* and he replied, “No, but I have accepted Islam along with God’s Messenger. I swear by God that not one grain of wheat will come to you from al-Yamama till God’s Messenger gives permission for it.”\n*Sabaut. The verb saba has as one of its meanings to turn to folly. It has been suggested that here it is used in the sense of the verb saba’a which means to change one’s religion. Final Hamza verbs very often do drop the Hamza, but they more normally follow the pattern of final ya’ verbs rather than final waw when they do so.\nMuslim transmitted it, and Bukhari gave it more concisely."

I saw one of the polytheists getting the better of one of the Muslims, so I struck him with my sword from behind on his shoulder-blade and cut his coat of mail. He came at me and closed with me, so that I felt death was near, but he was overtaken by death and let me go. I then caught up on ‘Umar b. al-Khattab and asked him what was the matter with the people, to which he replied that it was what God had commanded.1 Then they returned and the Prophet sat down and said, \"If anyone kills a man and can prove it he will get his spoil.” I said, \"Who will testify for me?” and then sat down. The Prophet said the same again and I said, \"Who will testify for me?”2 and then sat down. Again the Prophet said the same and I stood up He asked, \"What is the matter with you, Qatada?” and when I informed him a man said, \"He has spoken the truth. I have his spoil, so make him agreeable to take something in exchange.” Abu Bakr said, “In that case I swear by God that he did not do so. One of God’s heroes3 does not fight for God and His Messenger and then give you his spoil.” The Prophet said he had spoken the truth and told the man to hand it over to me. He did so, and I bought a garden among the B. Salima. This was the first property I acquired in the Islamic period.\n1. He wondered why the Muslims had fled from the enemy, and 'Umar replied that it was what God had decreed.\n2. There is doubt as to whether Abu Qatada spoke aloud the first two times, or inwardly. In the translation I have kept strictly to the wording in the Arabic.\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

Then I followed them shooting at them till they threw away more than thirty cloaks and thirty lances to lighten themselves, and they threw nothing away without my putting stones on it to mark it for God’s Messenger and his companions to notice them.

Aba Qatada, God's Messenger's horseman, caught up on 'Abd ar-Rahman and killed him, and God's Messenger said, “Our best horseman today is Abu Qatada and our best footman Salama.” He then gave me two portions a horseman’s and a footman’s, and after giving me them both he took me up behind him on al-‘Adba’ on our way back to Medina.\n*The line, which is evidently an example of the dimeter of the rajaz metre, has something missing at the beginning.

Abu Dawud transmitted it, saying Ibn ‘Umar’s tradition1 is sounder, and it is the one which is followed. The error in the tradition of Mujammi’ was because he said three hundred horsemen when there were only two hundred.\nHabib b. Maslama al-Fihri said he saw the Prophet give a quarter of the spoil on the outward journey and a third on the return journey.2\n1. I have available two editions of Abu Dawud’s Sunan (Cairo, 1280 and 1348 A .H.). Both give Ibn Mu'awiya in place of Ibn 'Umar. See Jihad, 144.\n2. This tradition and the following one are explained as referring to a section of the army which comes in contact with the enemy. The greater amount granted them when this happens on the return journey is because there is more difficulty and danger in fighting after having gone through the campaign. The second tradition is more explicit by making it clear that the fifth was deducted.\nAbu Dawud transmitted it."

Al-Qaswa’ has become jaded.” But the Prophet said, “Al- Qaswa’ has not become jaded, for that is not a characteristic of hers, but He who restrained the elephant1 has restrained her.” Then he said, “By Him in whose hand my soul is, they will not ask me any good thing by which they honour what God has made sacred without my giving them it.” He then urged her and she leaped up and he turned aside from the road to Mecca and stopped at the farthest point of al-Hudaibiya at a pool with little water which the people collected in small quantities and soon exhausted. Complaint of thirst was made to God’s Messenger, so he drew an arrow from his quiver and ordered them to put it in it, whereupon to their astonishment it kept gushing out to them with water till they left it. Meanwhile Budail b. Warqa’ al Khuza’i came with some members of Khuza’a and ‘Urwa b. Mas'ud joined him. He went on with the tradition2 to the point where he said that when Suhail b. ‘Amr came the Prophet said, “Write:\nThis is what Muhammad God's Messenger has decided.” Suhail protested, “I swear by God that if we knew you were God’s Messenger we would not turn you away from the House or fight with you; but write: Muhammad b. ‘Abdallah.” The Prophet replied, “I swear by God that I am God’s Messenger even if you disbelieve me; write Muhammad b. ‘Abdallah.” Suhail said, “And that a man will not come to you from us, even if he follows your religion, without your sending him back to us.\" Then when he finished drawing up the document God’s Messenger said to his companions, \"Get up and sacrifice, and then shave.” Thereafter some believing women came and God most high sent down, \"O you who believe, when believing women come to you as emigrants…”3 God most high forbade them to send them back, but ordered them to restore the dower. When the Prophet returned to Medina Abu Basir, a man of Quraish who was a Muslim, came to him and they sent two men to look for him, so he handed him over to the two men. They took him away, and when they reached Dhul Hulaifa and alighted to eat some dates which they had Abu Basir said to one of the men, \"I swear by God, so and so, that I think this sword of yours is a fine one; let me look at it.” He let him have it and he struck him till he died, whereupon the other fled from him and when he reached Medina went running into the mosque. The Prophet said, “This man has seen something frightful.” He said, “I swear by God that my companion has been killed, and I am as good as dead.”4 Abu Basir arrived and the Prophet said, \"Woe to his mother, stirrer up of war! Would that he had some kinsfolk!”5 When he heard that he knew that he would send him back to them, so he went out and came to the seashore. Abu Jandal b. Suhail escaped and joined Abu Basir, and it became the practice that every man of Quraish who went out having accepted Islam joined Abu Basir, till a band of them collected. Whenever they heard of a caravan which belonged to Quraish going out to Syria they intercepted it, killed the men and seized their goods; so Quraish sent a message to the Prophet adjuring him by God and the ties of relationship to send instructions to them to stop, and agreeing that anyone who came to him would be safe. So the Prophet sent them instructions.\n1. Cf. Al-Qur'an; 105.\n2. This indicates that a part of Bukhari’s tradition is omitted here.\n3. Al-Qur'an; 60:10.\n4. Literally “and I am killed.\"\n5. Literally “would that he had someone!” It probably means that the Prophet wished Abu Basir had had some kinsfolk to whom he could go, and so save him the necessity of returning him to Mecca.\n6. Bukhari's tradition is very long. In the version given here it is much reduced, the purpose evidently being to give the essential parts of it without including every detail.\nBukhari transmitted it.6"

      "text": "Abus Sa’ib said:\nWe went in to visit Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, and while we were sitting we heard a movement under his couch. When we had looked and found a snake in it I jumped up to kill it, but Abu Sa'id who was engaged in prayer made a gesture to me indicating that I should sit down, so I sat down. When he finished he pointed to a room in the house and asked if I saw it, and when I said I did he told me that a servant of theirs who had recently been married had occupied it. They went out with God’s messenger to the Trench, and that young man was asking permission from God’s messenger to leave after staying half the day and would return to his wife. One day when he asked God's messenger’s permission he told him to carry his weapons with him as he feared Quraiza might do him harm. The man took his weapons and returned, and finding his wife standing between the two doors he was smitten with jealousy and made to pierce her with his lance, but she told him to put away his lance and enter the house to see what had made her come out. He entered and found a huge snake coiled on the bedding, so he made for it with the lance and pierced it with it and then went out and fixed it in the ground in the house, but the snake quivered and attacked him, and no one knew which of them died first, the snake or the young man. They went to God's messenger and mentioned that incident to him, asking him to supplicate God to restore him to life for them, but he replied, \"Ask forgiveness for your friend.\" Then he said, \"These houses have resident jinn, so when you see one of them give it a warning three times. 1 If it goes away, well and good; otherwise kill it, for it is an infidel.'' He then told them to go and bury their friend. A version reports him as saying, ''In Medina there are jinn who have accepted Islam, so when you see one of them pronounce a warning to it for three days and if it appears to you after that kill it, for it is only a devil.\"\n1. Hiarrijiu ‘alaiha thalithan. The verb means to make things difficult. This phrase is explained as meaning that one should tell the snake three times that it will be in difficulties if it returns, and that it must not blame one if, after this warning, it is driven away and killed.\nMuslim transmitted it."

When they replied that it was hunger he said, \"It is the same with me. By Him in whose hand my soul is, what has brought you out has brought me out. Get up.\" They got up and went with him to a man of the Ansar, but he was not at home. When his wife saw him she gave a hearty welcome and God’s messenger asked her where so and so had gone, to which she replied that he had gone to get them some fresh water. At that moment the Ansari appeared, and seeing God’s messenger and his two companions he said, \"Praise be to God! No one has more honourable guests to-day than I.\" He then went and brought them a bunch containing ripening dates, dried dates and fresh dates, and telling them to eat some of that he took his knife. God’s messenger having warned him not to kill an animal which was giving milk, he killed a sheep for them; and after they had eaten of it and of the bunch and drunk to their satisfaction God’s messenger said to Abu Bakr and 'Umar, \"By Him in whose hand my soul is, you 1 will be questioned about this bounty on the day of resurrection. Hunger brought you out of your houses, then you did not return till this bounty came to you.\"\n1. It it noteworthy that the second person pronouns in this and the following sentence are plural although two people are addressed.\nMuslim transmitted it. Abu Mas'ud’s tradition, \"One of the Ansar...\" has been mentioned in the chapter on the wedding-feast. 2\n2. See p. 684."

Tie up you buckets, mentioning God's name; cover up your vessels, mentioning God’s name, even though you should just put something on them, and extinguish your lamps.”\n(Bukhari and Muslim.) In a version by Bukhari he said, “Cover up the vessels, tie the water-skins, shut the doors, and gather your children in the evening, for the jinn are abroad and seize them; and extinguish the lamps when you go to sleep, for a mouse often drags a wick and burns a household.” In a verison by Muslim he said, “Cover the vessel, tie up the water-skin, shut the doors and extinguish the lamp, for the devil does not loosen a water-skin, or open a door, or uncover a vessel. If all one can do is to put a piece of wood over his vessel and mention God's name let him do so, for a mouse sets a house on fire over its inhabitants.” In a version by him he said, “Do not let your animals and children go at large when the sun sets till the first and darkest part of the night has passed, for the devil is sent out; from the time the sun sets till the first and darkest part of the night is past.” In a version by him he said, “Cover the vessel and tie up the water-skin, for there is a night in the year when pestilence descends, and it does not pass an uncovered vessel or an untied water-skin without some of that pesti- lence descending into it.”"

Once when he returned from an expedition she had hung up a hair-cloth, or a curtain, at her door and adorned al-Hasan and al-Husain with silver bracelets, so when he arrived he did not enter. Thinking that he had been prevented from entering by what he had seen she tore down the curtain, unfastened the bracelets from the boys and cut them off them. They went weeping to God's messenger, and when he had taken them from them he said, “Take this to so and so’s family, Thauban. These are my family and I dislike their enjoying their good things in the present life. Buy Fatima a necklace of ‘asb( the meaning is not clear. It is suggested that it means the tendons of the joints of animals cut into beads, or the teeth or bones of the hippopotamus) , Thauban, and two ivory (Or, 'tortoise-shell’ (’aj) bracelets.”\nAhmad and Abu Dawud transmitted it."

Jundub said:\nWhen the Prophet prayed he turned his face to us and asked, “Who among you had a vision last night?” If one of us had had one he told it and he would interpret it as God willed. One day he asked us, “Has any of you had a vision?” and when we replied that we had not he said:\n“But last night I saw two men who came to me, took me by the hand and brought me out to a holy land. I saw a man sitting and a man standing with a hooked piece of iron in his hand which he was inserting into the other man's jaw and cleaving it till it reached the back of his neck, and doing the same with the other jaw. This jaw was recovering, and then he would do the same again. I asked what this was and they told me to come away. So we went on till we came to a man who was lying on his back over whom a man was standing with a stone the size of his hand, or a rock, with which he was pounding his head. When he struck him the stone rolled away and he went after it to get it, and did not return to this man till his head was healed and restored to its former condition. He then went back to him and struck him. I asked what this was and they told me to come away. So we went on till we came to a hole like an oven, narrow at the top and wide at the bottom, under which there was a fire. It contained naked men and women who when the fire rose mounted till they almost came out, but who returned into it when it subsided. I asked what this was and they told me to come away. So we went on till we came to a river of blood in the middle of which a man was standing and on the bank of which there was a man with some stones in front of him. The man who was in the river came forward and when he wanted to come out the other threw a stone into his mouth and sent him back where he came from; and as often as he tried to come out he threw a stone into his mouth and he returned to where he came from. I asked what this was and they\" told me to come away. So we went on till we reached a green garden containing a huge tree at the foot of which were an old man and some boys and near which there was a man in front of whom there was a fire which he was kindling. My two companions took me up the tree and brought me into a house in the middle of the tree more beautiful than any I had seen in which were old men, youths, women and boys. They then took me out of it and brought me up the tree and took me into a more beautiful and more excellent house in which were old men and youths. Telling them that they had taken me round this night, I asked them to inform me about what I had seen, to which they agreed.\nThey said that the man I had seen having his jaw cloven was a liar who told lies which were reported from him and carried to the ends of the earth, so what I had seen would be done to him till the day of resurrection. The man whose head I had seen being pounded was a man whom God had taught the Qur’an but who had slept at night and neglected it and had not acted according to its teachings in the daytime, so what I had seen would be done to him till the day of resurrection. Those I had seen in the hole were fornicators and the one I had seen in the river was the one who devoured usury. The old man I had seen at the foot of the tree was Abraham, the boys around him were the children of men, and the one who was kindling the fire was Malik the guardian of hell. The first house I entered was the abode of the generality of believers, but this house was the abode of the martyrs. One of them informing me that he was Gabriel and that the other was Michael told me to raise my head, and when I did so I saw something like a white cloud (a version giving cumulus cloud) and they told me that would be my abode. I asked them to let me enter my dwelling, but they told me I had still some time to live which I had not completed and that if I had completed it I would have entered my dwelling.”\nBukhari transmitted it."

They told me to go up into it, and when we had done so we came to a city built of gold and silver bricks. When we came to the gate of the city we asked that it should be opened, and when that was done and we had entered we were met by men half of whose frame was like the most beautiful you could see while the other half was like the most ugly you could see. There was a river opposite flowing with water as white as pure milk, and my companions told them to go and plunge into that river. They did so and returned to us having had that ugliness removed from them and having become most beautiful in appearance.\"\nIn the exposition of this addition he mentioned, “The tall man who was in the garden was Abraham and the children who were around him were all who had been born and had died following the true religion.\"\nSome Muslims asked God’s messenger about the children of the polytheists, and he replied that they were there too. He continued: “The people who, were half beautiful and half ugly were people Who had mixed a good deed with another which was evil and had been forgiven by God.\"\nBukhari transmitted it."

At the end of time the descendants of Qantura'[*] will come with broad faces and small eyes and alight on the bank of the river.

(Cf. Genesis, 25:1, which says that Abraham took a wife named Keturah -- in Hebrew Qeturah.) Ibn al-Athir, an-Nihaya fi gharib al-hadith, 3:314, says the Turks and Chinese were descended from the offspring of Qanturs'. Lisan al-'Arab, 6:432, says her offspring were the Turks, and some say the negroes. Mirqat, 5:166 f., finds a difficulty because Abraham was a descendant of Shem and the Turks were descended from Japheth. It suggests that Qantura' was a descendant of Abraham who married a descendant of Japheth. Dr. J.A. Boyle of Manchester University has drawn my attention to an article in the Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, 12:287, which quotes an Armenian historian, Grigor of Akner (1250-1335 A.D.), as saying that Kendura, a handmaiden of Abraham, bore Imran who became the ancestor of the Parthians."

He asked whether the door would be broken down or opened, and when I replied that it would be broken down, he said it would never likely be closed. Hudhaifa was asked if `Umar knew who the door was and he replied that he knew it as well as he knew that a night comes before tomorrow, adding that he had told him a tradition which included no misleading language. They were afraid to ask Hudhaifa who the door was, so they asked Masruq to ask him, and when he did so he replied that it was `Umar.3\nA man who has these responsibilities may fall short of what is due from him, but can make atonement for his shortcoming.\nContention which leads to strife and warfare.\nThe point of the tradition is that the fitna would not occur in `Umar's lifetime, but that as he was to be assassinated there was no hope of peaceful conditions ever returning.

      "text": "An-Nawwas b. Sam`a.n told that God's messenger mentioned the dajjal saying, \"If he comes forth while I am among you I shall be the one who will dispute with him on your behalf, but if he comes forth when I am not among you a man must dispute on his own behalf, and God will take my place in looking after every Muslim. He will be a youth with curly hair and a floating eye whom I might compare to `Abd al- `Uzza b. Qatan. Those of you who live till his time should recite over him the opening verses of sura al-Kahf[1] (a version having `should recite over him the opening verses of sura al-Kahf, for they are your protection from his trial'). He will come forth on a road between Syria and al- `Iraq and do mischief right and left. Stand firm, servants of God.\" God's messenger was asked how long he would remain in the earth and replied, \"Forty days, one like a year, one like a month, one like a week, and the rest of his days like yours.\" God's messenger was then asked if one day's prayer would suffice them in that day which would be like a year and replied, \"No, you must make an estimate of its extent.\" He was asked how quickly he would go in the earth and replied, \"Like rain driven along by the wind. He will come to people and summon them and they will believe in him. He will then give command to the sky and it will give rain and to the earth and it will produce crops. Then in the evening their pasturing animals will come to them with their humps as high as possible; their udders full of milk, and their flanks distended. He will then come to people and summon them, but they will reject what he says, so he will leave them. In the morning they will be destitute, possessing none of their property. He will pass the waste land and tell it to bring forth its treasures, and its treasures will follow him like swarms of bees. He will then summon a man in the prime of youth, strike him with a sword and cut him in two like a shot at a target, after which he will call him and he will come forward laughing with his face shining. But at that very moment God will send the Messiah son of Mary who will descend at the white minaret in the east of Damascus wearing two garments dyed with saffron and placing his hands on the wings of two angels. When he lowers his head, it will drip and when he raises it beads like pearls will scatter from it. Every infidel who feels the odour of his breath will die, and his breath will reach as far as he can see. He will then seek him till he catches up with him at the gate of Ludd and kills him. People whom God has protected from him will then come to Jesus who will wipe their faces and tell them of the ranks they will have in paradise. While this is happening God will reveal to Jesus that He has brought forth servants of His with whom no one will be able to fight and tell him to collect His servants at at-Tur. God will then release Gog and Magog and they will swarm down from every slope.' [2] The first of them will pass the lake of Tiberias and drink its contents and when the last[3] of them passes he will say there was once water there. They will then journey till they come to the mountain of thickets which is the mountain of Jerusalem and will say, `We have killed those who are in the earth come and let us kill those who are in heaven.' They will then shoot their arrows into the sky and God will send their arrows back to them dyed with blood; and God's prophet and his companions will be restrained till an ox-head seems better to one of them than a hundred dinars do to you to-day. God's prophet Jesus and his companions will then beseech God who will send to them insects in their necks and in the morning, they will have perished as if they were one person. God's prophet Jesus and his companions will then come down to the earth and will not find in the earth as much space as a span which is not filled with their putrefaction and stench. God's prophet Jesus and his companions will then beseech God who will send birds with necks like those of Bactrian camels and they will carry them and throw them where God wills. (A version says they will throw them in an-Nahbal[4] and the Muslims will burn their bows, arrows, and quivers for seven years.) God will then send a rain which no house of clay or camel's wool will keep out and it will wash the earth till it leaves it like a mirror. The earth will then be told to bring forth its fruit and restore its blessing, and on that day a company of people will eat a pomegranate and seek shelter in its skin, and the milk will be blessed so that a milch-camel will be sufficient for a number of people, a cow in milk will be sufficient for a tribe of men and a ewe will be sufficient for a clan of men. At that time God will send a pleasant wind which will take them under their arm pits and the spirit of every believer and every Muslim will be taken, but the wicked people will remain in the earth and will be disorderly like asses. Then the last hour will come to them.\"\n1-Quran, 18.\n2-Quran, 21:96.\n3-In the Arabic of this sentence the plural is used for 'first' and the singular for `last.'\n4-This appears as a proper name in the tradition, but Taj al-arus in the article hbl says this is an error for al-mahbal which means a great pit. Cf also Ibn al-Athir, Nihaya, 4:252.\nMuslim transmitted it, except for the second version which is \"They will throw them into an-Nahbal... seven years.\" That is transmitted by Tirmidhi."

The dajjal will then order that he be stretched out, saying, `Take him and stretch him out.' After he has been given many blows on his back and stomach, he will ask him if he does not believe in him, but he will reply that he is the false Messiah. He will then order him to be sawn with a saw from the parting of his hair to between his legs, after which the dajjal will walk between the two pieces and tell him to get up. When he stands up he will ask him if he believes in him, to which he will reply that he has simply received more insight into his true nature, adding, `0 people, no one will be treated thus after me.' The dajjal will then seize him to cut his throat, but the space between bis neck and his collar-bone will be turned into copper and he will find no way by which he can kill him, so he will take him by the hands and feet and throw him into the air, and the people will think he has thrown him into hell, but he will simply have been thrown into paradise.\" God's messenger said, \"This will be the one who suffers the severest martyrdom in the sight of the Lord of the universe.\"\nMuslim transmitted it."

      "text": "Fatima, daughter of Qais told that she had heard God's messenger's crier calling to congregational prayer, so she went out to the mosque and prayed along with God's messenger. When he had finished his prayer, he sat on the pulpit laughing and told everyone to remain where he had said the prayer. He then asked them if they knew why he had assembled them, and when they replied that God and His messenger knew best, he said, \"I swear by God that I have not assembled you for some pleasant purpose or because of fear, but I have assembled you because Tamim ad-Dari, a Christian who came and accepted Islam, told me something which agrees with what I was telling you about the antichrist. He told me that he had sailed in a ship along with thirty men of Lakhm and Judham and that they were storm-tossed for a month. They drew near to an island when the sun was setting and going into the ship's small boats they went ashore where they were met by a very hairy beast whose hair was so abundant that because of it they could not tell its front from its back. They said, `Woe to you! What can you be?' and it replied, `I am the Jassasa.1 Go to this man in the monastery, for he is anxious to get news of you.' He said that when it named a man to them, they were afraid of it lest it should be a she-devil so they went off quickly and entered the monastery where they found a man with the hugest and strongest frame they had ever seen with his hand joined to his neck and in irons from the knees to the ankles. They said, `Woe to you! Who are you?' and he replied that they had had the opportunity of knowing about him, so they must tell him who they were. They said they were Arabs who had sailed in a ship and after having been storm-tossed for a month had landed on the island where they were met by a very hairy beast which informed them that it was the jassasa and told them to go to this man in the monastery, so they had come to him quickly. He asked them to tell him about the palm trees of Baisan whether they were producing fruit, and when they told him that they were, he said they would soon cease to bear fruit. He asked them to tell him about the lake of Tiberias whether there was water in it, and when they replied that it contained a great quantity of water he said that its water, would soon disappear. He asked them to tell him about the spring of Zughar[2] whether there was any water in the spring and whether the people carried on agriculture with the spring water, to which they replied that it had a great quantity of water and that its people carried on agriculture with its water. He asked them to tell him what had happened to the prophet of the Gentiles and they told him he had left Mecca and settled in Yathrib. He asked whether the Arabs had fought with him and when they replied that they had, he asked how he had dealt with them and they replied that he had overcome those in his neighbourhood and they had obeyed him. Saying it would be best for them to obey him, he told them that he would now inform them about himself. He Poundaid he was the antichrist and would soon be permitted to come forth. He would then come forth and travel in the earth for forty nights, not leaving a town unvisited except Mecca and Taiba[3] both of which are forbidden to him, for as often as he wanted to enter one of them he would be faced by an angel with a drawn sword in his hand who would turn him away from it, and on every one of its mountain paths there would be angels guarding it.\" Then striking the pulpit with the end of his staff, God's messenger said, \"This is Taiba, this is Taiba, this is Taiba (meaning Medina). Have J told you [a story like this]?\" On their replying that he had, he said, \"I assure you that he is in the Syrian sea or the Yemen Sea; no, on the contrary, it is towards the East that he is and he pointed his hand to the East.\n1. The name of a beast which is to seek for news to take to the dajjal.\n2. Different explanations are given of this name. It is said to have been a spring in the Balqa in Syria and to have been connected with a daughter of Lot.\n3. A name for Medina.\nMuslim transmitted it."

Maghala, Ibn Sayyid at that time being near the age of puberty. Before he was aware God's messenger gave him a clap on the back and said, \"Do you testify that I am God's messenger?\" He looked at him and said, \"I testify that you are the messenger of the Gentiles,\" after which Ibn Sayyad said, \"Do you testify that I am God's messenger?\" The Prophet squeezed him and said, \"I believe in God and His messengers.\" He then asked Ibn Sayyad what visions he had, and when he replied, \"One who speaks the truth and one who lies comes to me,\" God's messenger said, \"You are confused.\" He then said, \"I have concealed something in my mind which I would like you to tell me\" (referring to \"the day when the sky will bring forth smoke (dukhan) clearly visible\").[1] On his replying, \"It is smoke (dukhkh),\" he said,\n\"Away with you! You cannot get farther than your rank.\"[2] `Umar then asked God's messenger if he would permit him to cut off his head, but he replied, \"If he is the one[3] you will not be given power over him, and if he is not, you will not do well in killing him.\" Ibn `Umar told that sometime afterwards God's messenger and Ubayy b. Ka'b went towards the palm trees where Ibn Sayyid was, and God's messenger hid behind the palm trunks seeking stealthily to hear something from Ibn Sayyid before he could see him. Ibn Sayyid was lying on his bed in a wrapper from which a murmur issued, and when his mother saw the Prophet hiding behind the palm trunks she said, \"Saf '(that being his name), here is Muhammad,\" whereupon Ibn Sayyad stopped the murmuring, and God's messenger said, \"If you had left him alone, he would have made things clear.\" `Abdallah b. `Umar told that God's messenger stood up among the people, and when he had extolled God - in a fitting manner he mentioned the dajjal and said, \"I warn you of him, and there is no prophet who has not warned his people.

They will then go to Abraham and he, mentioning three lies he told, will say, `I am not in a position to do that for you, but go to Moses, a servant to whom God brought, the Torah, to whom He spoke, and whom He brought near Him as a confidant.' They will then go to Moses and he, mentioning the sin he committed when he took a life, will say, `I am not in a position to do that for you, but go to Jesus, God's servant and messenger, God's spirit and word.' They will then go to Jesus and he will say, `I am not in a position to do that for you, but go to Muhammad, a servant whose former and latter sins have been forgiven him by God.' They will then come to me and I shall ask permission to enter my Lord's abode.

Do you disagree about seeing the sun at noonday when it is unconcealed and there are no clouds, or do you disagree about seeing the moon on the night when it is full when it is unconcealed and there are no clouds?\" On their replying that they did not, he said, \"You will not disagree about the vision of God on the day of resurrection any more than you do about seeing one of them. When the day of resurrection comes a mu'adhdhinwill cry, `Let every people follow what it was worshipping.' Then all who worshipped idols and stones apart from God will fall one after the other into hell, and when only the righteous and wicked who worshipped God are left the Lord of the universe will come to them and say, `What are you waiting for? Let every people follow what it was worshipping.' They will reply, `Our Lord, we kept separate from the people in the world though we felt great need of them, and did not associate with them.' (In Abu Huraira's version they will say, `This is our place till our Lord comes to us, and when our Lord comes to us we shall recognize Him.') In Abu Sa'id's version He will say, `Is there a sign between you and Him by which you will recognize Him? On their replying that there is, things will be made plain[1]. Those who prostrated themselves before God for His sake will all be permitted by God to prostrate themselves, but those who prostrated themselves for self-protection and show will all have their backs made into one piece by God and will fall on the back of their necks as often as they wish to prostrate themselves. The bridge will then he set up over Jahannam and intercession will be allowed, and they[2] will say, `O God, keep safe, keep safe.' The believers will then pass over like the twinkling of an eye, like lightning, like wind, like a bird, like the finest horses and camels. Some will escape and be kept safe, some will be lacerated and let go, and some will be pushed into the fire of Jahannam. Then when the believers are safe from hell, I swear by Him in whose hand my soul is that none of you is more eager to claim a right when it has become clear to you than those who believe in God will be on the day of resurrection to make claims on behalf of their brethren who are in hell. They will say, `0 our Lord, they were fasting along with us, praying and performing pilgrimage, and will be told to bring out those they recognize. Their faces will be protected from the fire and they will bring forth a large number of people, then say, `O our Lord, not one of those about whom Thou didst give us command remains in it.' He will reply, `Go back and bring forth those in whose hearts you find as much as a dinar of good.' When they have brought forth a large number of people He will say, `Go back and bring forth those in whose hearts you find as much as half a dinar of good.' When they have brought forth a large number of people He will say, 'Go back and bring forth those in whose hearts you find as much as an atom of good.' When they have brought forth a large number of people they will say, `O our Lord, we have not left in it any good.' Then God will say, 'The angels have interceded, the prophets have interceded, the believers have interceded, and only the Most Merciful of the merciful ones remains.' He will then take a handful from hell, bring forth from it people who never did any good, who have been turned into charcoal and cast them into a river at the outskirts of paradise called the river of life. They will come out as a seed comes out from the rubbish carried away by a flood, and they will come forth like pearls with seals on their necks. The inhabitants of paradise will say, `Those are they who have been set free by the Compassionate One who has brought them into paradise without anything they have done or any good they have sent before them.' They will then be told that theirs is what they see and a like quantity along with it.\"\nQuran, 48:42 The reference is either to the beginning of terrors, or to the end of all mystery. The second of the two meanings given seems to fit this passage.\nPresumably the Prophets, but later in this tradition reference is made to intercession having been made by angels, prophets and believers.

On that day only the messengers will speak and what they say that day will be, `0 God, keep safe, keep safe.' In jahannam there will be pronged flesh-hooks like sadan[2] thorns whose size is known only to God, and they will seize people for their deeds, some being confined for what they have done and others being cut in small pieces and escaping. Then when God finishes judging His servants and desires to take out of hell such people as He pleases among those who testified that there is no god but God, He will command the angels to bring out those who worshipped God. They will do so, recognising them by the marks of prostration, God most high having prevented hell from devouring the mark of prostration, for hell will devour everything in the sons of Adam except the mark of prostration. They will come forth from hell having been burned, the water of life will be poured over them, and they will sprout as a seed does in the rubbish carried away by a flood. Bat a man who will be the last of the inhabitants of hell to enter paradise will remain between paradise and hell facing hell and will say, `0 my Lord, turn my face away from hell, for its odour has annoyed me and its fierce blaze has burned me; but God will reply, 'If I do that you will perhaps ask something else.' He will say, `No, by Thy might,' giving God such covenant and agreement as God wishes, and He will turn his face away from hell. When he is turned to face paradise and sees its beauty, he will remain silent as long as God wishes him to remain so, and will then say, 'O my Lord, bring me forward to the gate of paradise.' God who is blessed and exalted will reply, `Did you not give covenants and agreement that you would not ask anything beside what you have asked?' and he will say, `O my Lord, let me not be made the most miserable of Thy creatures.' He will ask, `What else are you likely to ask for if you are granted that?' and he will reply, `No, by Thy might, I shall ask nothing else.' He will then give his Lord such covenant and agreement as He wishes, and He will bring him forward to the gate of paradise. Then when he reaches its gate and sees its freshness and the splendour and joy it contains, he will remain silent as long as God wishes him to remain so, and will then say, `O my Lord, bring me into paradise.' God who is blessed and exalted will reply, `Woe to you, son of Adam, how treacherous you are! Have you not given covenants and agreement that you would not ask anything more than you have been granted?' and he will say, `O my Lord, do not make me the most miserable of Thy creatures.' He will continue making supplication till God laughs at him, and when He does so He will give him permission to enter paradise, and will say, `State your wish.' When he has done so till his wishing has come to an end God most high will say, `State your wish from such and such,' his Lord mentioning the matters to him. Then when there is nothing more he can wish God will say, `You can have that and a similar amount along with it'.\" In Abu Sa'id's version God says, \"You can have that and ten times as much.\"\ni.e., they will have everything as far as their eyes can see.\nThe name of a plant with a prickly head on which camels pasture.\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

His attention will then be drawn to a tree more beautiful than the first and he will say, `O my Lord, bring me near this tree in order that I may drink some of its water and shelter in its shade. I shall not ask Thee for anything else.' He will reply, `Son of Adam, did you not covenant with me not to ask anything else?' and He will add, `If I bring you near it you will perhaps ask me for something else.' He will then covenant with Him not to ask for anything else, and his Lord will excuse him because he is seeing something he cannot help desiring, so He will bring him near it and he will shelter in its shade and drink some of its water. His attention will then be drawn to a tree at the gate of paradise more beautiful than the first two and he will say, `O my Lord, bring me near this tree so that I may shelter in its shade and drink some of its water, and I shall not ask Thee for anything else.' He will reply, `Son of Adam, did you not covenant with me not to ask me for anything else?' and he will say, `Certainly, my Lord, but I shall not ask Thee for anything else than this.' So his Lord will excuse him because he is seeing something he cannot help desiring and will bring him near it; but when He does so he will hear the voices of the inhabitants of paradise and say, `0 my Lord, bring me into it.' He will reply, `Son of Adam, what will bring an end to your making requests of me? Will it please you if I give you the world and a like amount along with it?' He will `say, '0 my Lord, art Thou mocking me when Thou art the Lord of the universe?'\" Ibn Mas'ud then laughed and asked his hearers why they did not ask him what he was laughing at. On their doing so he told them that God's messenger had laughed similarly, and when he was asked what he was laughing at he said, \"At the Lord of the universe laughing when he said, `Art Thou mocking me when Thou art the Lord of the universe?' He will reply, `I am not mocking you, but I have power to do whatever I will'.\"\nMuslim transmitted it."

They will then be granted permission for the period of a Friday in this world and will visit their Lord whose throne will be shown to them, and He will appear to them in one of the gardens of paradise. Pulpits of light, pulpits of pearls, pulpits of rubies, pulpits of chrysoprase, pulpits of gold and pulpits of silver will be placed for them, and the humblest of them, for there is no one worthless among them, will sit on mounds of musk and camphor, not considering that those who are on the chairs are in a more excellent position than they. Abu Huraira told that he asked, \"Messenger of God, shall we see our Lord?\" to which he replied, \"Yes, are you in doubt about seeing the sun and the moon on the night when it is full?\" On receiving the reply that they were not, he said, \"Similarly you will have no doubts about the vision of your Lord, and no man will remain in that assembly without God conversing with him, till he says to one of them, `So and so son of so and so, do you remember the day you said such and such?' and He will remind him of one of the dishonest things he did in the world. He will say, `0 my Lord, hast Thou not forgiven me?' and He will reply, `Yes; by the wideness of my forgiveness, you have reached this station of yours.' While that is taking place a cloud will overshadow them from above and rain on them perfume whose fragrance will be such as they have never experienced my thing to compare with, and our Lord will say, `Get up and go to the honour I have prepared for you, and take what you desire.' We shall then come to a market surrounded by angels containing such things as eyes have never seen, ears have never heard, and hearts have never thought of. What we desire will be conveyed to us, there being no buying or selling in it, and in that market the inhabitants of paradise will meet one another. A man of exalted station will come forward and meet one who is humbler than he, though there is no one worthless among them, who will be charmed by the clothing he sees him wearing, but before their talk comes to an end, he will imagine that he has something more beautiful than the other. That is because it is not fitting for anyone to grieve in it. We shall then go to our dwellings and our wives will meet us and say, `Welcome; you have come with more excellent beauty than you had when you left us.' We shall reply, To-day we have had a meeting with our Lord, the Overpowering One, and it is fitting that we should come away as we have done'.\"\nTirmidhi and Ibn Majah trans - mitted it, Tirmidhi saying this is a gharib tradition"

They will cry for help and will be helped with food of dari' [1] which neither fattens nor satisfies hunger. They will then call for food and will be fed with food which chokes[2]. So, remembering that they helped down choking food with drink when they were in the world they will ask for drink and the scalding drink[3] will be presented to them on iron flesh-hooks. When they approach their faces they will scorch their faces, and when they enter their bellies, they will cut in pieces the contents of their bellies. They will then ask the guards of Jahannam to be called and they will say, `Did your messengers not bring you the clear signs?' and when they reply, `Yes,' they will say, `Then make supplication, but the supplication of the infidels is only in error[4].' They will then ask Malik to be called and will say, `0 Malik, would that your Lord might put an end to us!' He will reply to them, `You are remaining'[5] (al-A`mash[6] saying he had been informed that the period between their appeal and Malik's reply to them would be a thousand years). They will then say, `Call your Lord, for no one is better than your Lord,' and they will say, `0 our Lord, our adversity was too much for us and we were a people who were astray. 0 our Lord, bring us out of it; then if we return to evil, we shall indeed be wrongdoers.' He will then answer them, `Retreat into it in shame and do not speak to Me[7].'

One day when he and Sarah came by a tyrant who was told that there was a man present accompanied by a most beautiful woman, he sent for him and asked him who she was, to which he replied that she was his sister. He then went to Sarah and told her that if this tyrant knew she was his wife he would take her away from him, so if he asked her, she must inform him she was his sister[3], she being his sister in Islam, for he and she were the only believers on the face of the earth. She was sent for arid brought to him and Abraham stood up and prayed. When she entered his presence, he was about to touch her with his hand, but he had a seizure (a variant saying that he choked) and kicked the ground with his feet. He asked her to supplicate God for him, saying he would do her no harm, and she did so; but when he was set free, he stretched out to touch her a second time and suffered a similar or a more severe seizure. He asked her to supplicate God for him, saying he would do her no harm, and she did so. He then called one of his chamberlains, and saying that it was not a human being but a devil he had brought him, he told him to give her Hagar as a servant. She came to Abraham while he was standing in prayer, and he made a sign with his hand indicating that he was asking what had happened. She told him that God had thrown back the infidel's scheme in his throat and given Hagar as a servant.\" Abu Huraira said, \"That was your mother, B. Ma' as-Sama'.'?[4]\nQuran, 37: 89.\nQuran, 21: 63.\nCf. Genesis, 12:11 ff.\nThis is said to be a general term for the Arabs because they sought out places where rain fell.\nMa' as-sama' means literally \"the water of the sky.\" Ma' as-sama' was a laqab of Mawiya, mother of al-Mundhir III, king of al-Hira, but it is difficult to see how that has any connection here. Ma' as sama' is also said to be applied to Zamzam, which is traditionally said to be the well which the angel revealed to Hagar and her son Ishmael. That might justify the suggestion that Abu Huraira is here referring to the northern Arabs in particular.\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

      "text": "Muhammad b. Isma'il al-Bukhari said sixty-three is the commonest statement. `A'isha said:\nThe first revelation God's messenger received was the true vision in sleep, and every vision he saw came like the bright gleam of dawn. He then became fond of solitude and would go alone to the cave on Hira where he would engage in tahannuth, which means worship for a number of nights, before feeling a yearning for his family. He would take provisions for that purpose, then he would return to Khadija and get provisions for a like period, till the truth came to him when he was in the cave on Hira. The angel came to him and said, `Recite,'[1] to which he replied, \"I am not a reciter.\" He said, \"He then took me and squeezed me till I was distressed, after which he let me go and said, `Recite.' When I replied, `I am not a reciter,' he took me and squeezed me a second time till I was distressed, then letting me go he said, `Recite;' When I replied, \"I am not a reciter,' he took me and squeezed me a third time till I was distressed. He then let me go and said, `Recite! In the name of your Lord who created, created man from a clot of blood. Recite! And your most bountiful Lord is He who taught the use of the pen, taught man what he did not know.' \"[2]\nGod's messenger came back with the verses, his heart trembling, and went in to Khadija and, said \"Wrap me up, wrap me up.\" So, they wrapped him up till the terror had left him. He then spoke to Khadija and informed her of what had happened, saying, \"I fear for myself.\" She replied, \"By no means! I swear by God that God will never shame you. You join ties of relationship, you speak the truth, you bear people's burdens, you give to the destitute, you entertain guests, and you help against the vicissitudes which affect people's rights.\" Khadija then took him to Waraqa b. Naufal, her paternal cousin, and said to him, \"Listen, cousin, to what your nephew has to say.\" Waraqa said to him, \"Son of my brother, what do you see?'' God's messenger then informed him about what he had seen and Waraqa said, \"It is the namus[3] which God sent down to Moses. Would that I were a young man during your prophetic career! Would that I might be alive when your people expel you!\" God's messenger asked, \"Will they expel me?'' and he replied, \"Yes; no man has ever brought anything like what you have brought without meeting hostility. If I see your day, I shall give you strong help.\"Waraqa died soon afterwards, and there was an intermission in the inspiration.\n1. The word iqra means either \"recite\" or \"read\". The former is to be preferred here.\n2. Quran; 96:1-5.\n3. This word is most likely derived from the Greek nomos (law). It indicates the revelation of scripture in the form of a divine law such as that given to Moses. \"The suggestion may also have been present that Muhammad should be the founder or legislator of a community\" (W. M. Watt, Muhammad at Mecca, Oxford, 1953, p. 51).\n(Bukhari and Muslim.) Bukhari added: so that the Prophet was grieved, as we have heard, and on that account went out in the morning several times to throw himself down from the heights of the mountain; but as often as he reached the summit of a mountain to throw himself from it, Gabriel appeared to him and said, \"Muhammad, you are truly God's messenger.\" On that account his turmoil would then quieten and he would feel at ease."

If you live long enough you will certainly see a woman travelling from al-Hira to go round the Ka'ba, fearing no one but God; if you live long enough the treasures of Kisra will certainly be conquered; if you live long enough you will certainly see a man coming out with a handful of gold or silver looking for someone to accept it but finding no one to accept it from him.[1] One of you will certainly meet God on the day he meets Him with no one between them to interpret for him. He will then certainly say, `Did I not send you a messenger who was conveying the message to you?' He will reply, `Certainly.' He will then say, `Did I not give you property and show favour to you?' He will reply, `Certainly;' then he will look to his right and see only Jahannam, and he will look to his left and see only Jahannam. Guard against hell, even though it be with half a date;[2] and if anyone cannot get so much, he should do it with a good word.\" `Adi said: I have seen a woman travelling from al-Hira to go round the Ka'ba, fearing no one but God; I was among those who conquered the treasures of Kisra, son of Hurmuz; and if you live long enough you will see what the Prophet Abul Qasim said, one coming out with his hand full.\nBecause there will be no poor at that time.\nAs alms.\nBukhari transmitted it."

      "text": "Ibn `Abbas said Abu Sufyan b. Harb told him the following by word of mouth:\nDuring the period of peace between God's messenger and me I went off, and while I was in Syria a letter was brought from the Prophet to Hiraql. Dihya al-Kalbi brought it and handed it to the governor of Busra who handed it to Hiraql. Hiraql asked whether there was anyone there belonging to the people of that man who asserted `that he was a prophet, and when he was told that there was, I was summoned along with some members of Quraish. We entered the presence of Hiraql who made us sit in front of him and then asked, \"Which of you is most closely related to this man who asserts that he is a prophet?\" When I said that I was, they made me sit in front of him and made my companions sit behind me. He then called for his interpreter and said, \"Tell them I am asking this man about this one who asserts he is a prophet, and that if he lies to me, they must accuse him of falsehood.\" (Abd Sufyan swore by God that if he had not been afraid of his falsehood being reported, he would have lied to him.) He said to his interpreter, \"Ask him about the-nature of his lineage among them,\" and I replied, \"He is a man of high lineage among us.\" He asked, \"Has there been any king among his ancestors?\" and I replied that there had not been any. He asked whether we had suspected him of falsehood before he said what he had said, and I replied that we had not. He asked whether he was followed by the nobles among the people or by the weak ones, and I replied that he was followed by the weak ones. He asked whether their numbers were increasing or diminishing, and I replied that they were increasing. He asked whether any apostatised from his religion after accepting it through displeasure with him, and I replied that they did not. He asked if we had fought with him, and I replied that we had. He asked the nature of our fighting with him, and I replied that it had its ups and downs, he neither getting the better of us nor we getting the better of him. He asked if he employed treachery, and I replied that he did not, but added that during that period we did not know what he was doing. I swear by God that he did not give me an opportunity of inserting a word except on this occasion. He asked if anyone had said what he was saying before him, and I replied that no one had. He then told his interpreter to say to me, \"I asked you about his lineage among you and you asserted that he had a high lineage among you; and messengers are commissioned thus from the high families of their people. I asked you whether any of his ancestors had been a king and you asserted that none had, for if any of his ancestors had been a king, I would have considered him to be a man who was seeking the kingdom of his ancestors. I asked you about his followers whether they were weak people or nobles, to which you replied that they were their weak ones, and such are the followers of the messengers. I asked you whether you suspected him of falsehood before he said what he has said, and you replied that you did not, so I recognised that he was not one to avoid falsehood about men and then go and lie about God. I asked you whether any of them apostatised from his religion after accepting it through displeasure with him, to which you replied that none had, and thus is faith when its cheerfulness mingles with hearts. I asked you whether they were increasing or diminishing, to which you replied that they were increasing, and thus is faith till it is complete. I asked you whether you fought with him, and you asserted that the war between you and him had its ups; and downs, he sometimes getting the better of you and you sometimes getting the better of him; now thus messengers are tested, after which the issue turns out in their favour. I asked you if he employed treachery and you asserted that he did not; now that is how the messengers are, not employing treachery. I asked you whether anyone had said what he was saying before him, and you asserted ta t no one had done so, for if someone had said this before him, I would have said he was a man who copied something said before his time.\" He then asked what he commanded us and we replied, \"He commands us to observe prayer, zakat, ties of relationship, and chastity.\" He then said, \"If what you say is true, he is a prophet. I knew he would come forth but did not think it would be from among you. If I knew I could get to him I would like to meet him, and if I were with him, I would wash his feet. His kingdom will certainly reach to what is under my feet.\" He then called for God's messenger's letter and read it.\n(Bukhari and Muslim.) The completion of the tradition has already been given in the chapter on writing to infidels."

      "text": "Qatada quoted the authority of Anas b. Malik who quoted the authority of Malik b. Sa'sa'a to the effect that God's prophet told them about the night when he was taken up to heaven, saying, \"While I was lying down at al-Hatim[2] (but perhaps he said al-Hijr), someone came to me and made a split from here to here (meaning from the pit of his chest to the hair below his navel), then took out my heart. I was next brought a gold dish full of faith, and my heart was washed, then filled up and put back. (A version says the inside was washed with Zamzam water, after which it was filled with faith and wisdom.) I was then brought a beast smaller than a mule and larger than a donkey, which was white, was called al-Buraq, and stepped a distance equal to the range of its vision. I was mounted on it, and Gabriel went with me till he came to the lowest heaven. He asked that the gate be opened, and when he was asked who he was he replied that he was Gabriel. He was asked who was with him and replied that it was Muhammad. He was asked whether he had been sent for, and when he replied that that was so, the words were uttered, `Welcome; his coming is good,' and the gate was opened. When I entered Adam was there, and Gabriel said, `This is your father Adam, so give him a salutation. I did so, and when he had returned my salutation he said, `Welcome to the good son and the good prophet.' Gabriel then took me up till he came to the second heaven. He asked that the gate be opened, and when he was asked who he was he replied that he was Gabriel. He was asked who was with him and replied that it was Muhammad. He was asked whether he had been sent for, and when he replied that that was so, the words were uttered, `Welcome; his coming is good' and the gate was opened. When I entered John[3] and Jesus, who were cousins on the mother's side, were there, and Gabriel said, `These are John and Jesus, so give them a salutation I did so, and when they had returned my salutation they said, `Welcome to the good brother and the good prophet.' Gabriel then took me up to the third heaven. He asked that the gate be opened, and when he was asked who he was he replied that he was Gabriel. He was asked who was with him, and replied that it was Muhammad. He was asked whether he had been sent for, and when he replied that that was so, the words were uttered, `Welcome, his coming is good and the gate was opened. When I entered Joseph was there, and. Gabriel said, this is Joseph, so give him a salutation.' I did so, and when he had returned my salutation he said, `Welcome to the good brother and the good prophet.' Gabriel then took me up till he came to the fourth heaven. He asked that the gate be opened, and when he was asked who he was he replied that he was Gabriel. He was asked who was with him and replied that it was Muhammad. He was asked whether he had been sent for, and when he replied th at th at was so, the words were uttered, `Welcome; his coming is good,' and the gate was opened. When I entered Idris was there, and Gabriel said, `This is Idris, so give him a salutation.' I did so, and when he had returned my salutation he said, `Welcome to the good brother and the good prophet.' Gabriel then took me up till he came to the fifth heaven. He asked that the gate be opened, and when he was asked who he was he replied that he was Gabriel. He was asked who was with him and replied that it was Muhammad. He was asked whether he had been sent for, and when he replied that that was so, the words were uttered, `Welcome; his coming is good,' and the gate was opened. When I entered Aaron was there, and Gabriel said, `This is Aaron, so give him a salutation' I did so, and when he had returned my salutation he said, `Welcome to the good brother and the good prophet.' Gabriel then took me up till he came to the sixth heaven. He asked that the gate be opened, and when he was asked who he was he replied that he was Gabriel. He was asked who was with him and replied that it was Muhammad. He was asked whether he had been sent for, and when he replied that that was so, the words were uttered, `Welcome; his coming is good,' and the gate was opened. When I entered Moses was there, and Gabriel said, `This is Moses, so give him a salutation.' I did so, and when he had returned my salutation he said, `Welcome to the good brother and the good prophet.' Then when I passed on he wept, and when he was asked what was making him weep he replied, `I am weeping because more followers of a young man who was commissioned after my time will enter paradise than of mine.' Gabriel then took me up to the seventh heaven. He asked that the gate be opened, and when he was asked who he was he replied that he was Gabriel. He was asked who was with him and replied that it was Muhammad. He was asked whether he had been sent for and when he replied that that was so, the words were uttered, `Welcome; his coming is good.' When I entered Abraham was there, and Gabriel said, `This is your father Abraham, so give him a salutation.' I did so, and when he had returned my salutation he said, `Welcome to the good son and the good prophet.' I was then taken up to the lote tree of the boundary[4] and saw that its fruits were like the earthenware vessels of Hajar and its leaves like elephants' ears. He told me that this was the lote-tree of the boundary. I saw four rivers, two concealed and two apparent, and. when I asked Gabriel what these two pairs were, he replied, `The two concealed ones are rivers in paradise, and the two apparent ones are the Nile and the Euphrates.' After that I was shown the frequented house.[5] I was then brought a vessel of wine, a vessel of milk, and a vessel of honey, and when I took the milk he said, `It is the true religion[6] which you and your people follow.' Then fifty daily prayers were prescribed for me, but when I returned and passed Moses and on being asked by him what worship I had been commanded replied that I had been commanded to observe fifty daily prayers, he said, `Your people are not capable of observing fifty daily prayers. I swear by God that I have tested men before your time and have laboured most earnestly to prevail over the B. Isra'il, so go back to your Lord and ask Him to make things lighter for your people.' I did so, and when He had reduced them by ten, I returned to Moses. He said the same as before, so I went back, and when He had reduced them by ten, I returned to Moses. He said the same as before, so I went back, and when He had reduced them by ten, I returned to Moses. He said the same as before, so I went back, and when He had reduced them by ten and I had been ordered to observe ten daily prayers I returned to Moses. He said the same as before, so I went back, and when I had been ordered to observe five daily prayers I returned to Moses. He asked what I had been ordered, and when I replied that I had been ordered to observe 'five daily prayers he said, `Your people are not capable of observing five daily prayers. I have tested men before your time and have laboured most earnestly to prevail over the B. Isra'il, so go back to your Lord and ask Him to make things lighter for your people.' I replied, `I have asked my Lord till I am ashamed, but now I am satisfied and I submit.' Then when I passed on a crier called, `I have executed what I have made obligatory and have made things light for my servants'.\"\n1. Literally 'the ascent'.

I mounted it and came to Jerusalem, then tied It to the ring used by the prophets. Then after entering the mosque and praying two rak'as in it I came out and Gabriel brought me a vessel of wine and a vessel of milk. I chose the milk, and Gabriel said, `You have chosen the true religion.' We were then taken up to heaven ...\" and he went on with something to the same effect as has been mentioned already. He said, \"I found Adam who welcomed me and prayed for my wellbeing.\" Regarding the third heaven he said, \"I found Joseph who had been given half of beauty[*], and he welcomed me and prayed for my wellbeing.\" But he did not mention the weeping of Moses. Regarding the seventh heaven he said, \"I found Abraham supporting his back against the frequented house which is entered daily by seventy thousand angels who do not return to it.

When what God commands overshadows it, it changes, and none of God's creatures can describe it because of its beauty. God revealed to me what He revealed and made obligatory for-me fifty prayers every day and night. I came down to Moses who asked what my Lord had made obligatory for my people, and when I told him He had prescribed fifty prayers every day and night he said, `Go back to your Lord and ask Him to make things lighter, for your people are not capable of that. I have tested and had experience of the B. Isra'il.' I went back to my Lord and said, `0 my Lord, make things lighter for my people,' so He relieved me of five. When I returned to Moses and told him He had relieved me of five he said, `Your people are not capable of that, so go back to your Lord and ask Him to make things lighter.' I then kept going back and forth between my Lord and Moses till He said, `They are five prayers every day and night, Muhammad, each being credited as ten, so that makes fifty times of prayer. He who intends to do a good deed and does not do it will have a good deed recorded for him, and if he does it, it will be recorded for him as ten; whereas he who intends to do an evil deed and does not do it will have nothing recorded for him, and if he does it one evil deed will be recorded for him.' I then came down, and when I came to Moses and told him he said, `Go back to your Lord and ask Him to make things lighter'.\" God's messenger said that he replied, \"I have gone back to my Lord till I am ashamed to face Him.\"\n*Mirqat, 5:432, says this may either mean half of the whole category of beauty, or half of the beauty of all his contemporaries.\nMuslim transmitted it."

He then brought a gold dish full of wisdom and faith, and after emptying it into my breast he closed it up. Then taking me by the hand he ascended with me to heaven, and when I came to the lowest heaven Gabriel said to the guardian of heaven, `Open.' He asked who was there, and when he replied that it was Gabriel, he asked whether anyone was with him. When he replied that he had Muhammad with him he was asked whether he had been sent for and replied that he had. When the gate was opened, we went up into the lowest heaven and I saw a man sitting with people on his right and people on his left. When he looked to his right he laughed, and when he looked to his left he wept. He said, `Welcome to the good prophet and the good son.' I asked Gabriel who this was and he replied, `This is Adam, and these people on his right and his left are the souls of his descendants. Those of them on his right are the inhabitants of paradise and those on his left are the inhabitants of hell, so when he looks to his right he laughs and when he looks to his left he weeps.' He then took me up to the second heaven and said to its guardian, `Open,' and its guardian said to him the same as the first one had said.\" Anas said he mentioned that he had found in the heavens Adam, Idris, Moses, Jesus and Abraham, hut did not specify the nature of their abodes, except th a t he mentioned he had found Adam in the lowest heaven and Abraham in the sixth. Ibn Shihab said he was told by Ibn Hazm that Ibn `Abbas and Abu Habba al-Ansar! used to say that the Prophet said, \"I was then taken up till I mounted a height in which I heard the scraping of the pens.\" Ibn Hazm and Anas told that the Prophet said, ``God then made fifty prayers obligatory for my people and I returned with that. When I passed Moses, he asked what God had made it obligatory for me to impose on my people, and when I told him He had made fifty I prayers obligatory he said, `Go back to your Lord, for your people are | not capable.' So, he sent me back and half of them were remitted, and i! when I returned to Moses and told him that half of them had been i remitted, he said, `Go back to your Lord, for your people are not capable.' I went back and repeated what I had said, and half of them were remitted. I then returned to him and he said, `Go back to your Lord, for your I people are not capable of that.' I went back to Him and He said, `They are five and at the same time fifty. What has been said is not changed with Me.' I then returned to Moses, and when he told me to go back to my Lord I replied, `I am ashamed to face my Lord.' He then travelled; with me till he brought me to the lote-tree of the boundary covered with colours, what they were I do not know.

Seeing a tall, shady rock protected from the sun's rays we alighted beside it, and when I had smoothed a place with my hands for him to sleep and spread a skin garment over him, I said, \"Sleep, messenger of God, and I shall keep watch around you.\" He went to sleep, and when I went out to keep watch around him, I saw a shepherd approaching. I asked if his sheep had any milk and he replied that they had, so I asked if he would draw some milk and he agreed, and drew a cupful into a wooden cup. I had a small skin vessel I carried for the Prophet from which he took water both for drinking and for performing ablution, so I went to the Prophet, but as I did not like to waken him, I waited for him till he awoke. I then poured some water on the milk till the bottom of it was cooled, and said, \"Drink, messenger of God.\" When he had drunk an amount which made me feel pleased, he said, \"Is it not time to be moving?\" and I agreed that it was; so, we moved on after the sun had passed the meridian. Suraqa b. Malik had followed us up and I said, \"We have been overtaken, messenger of God.\" He replied, \"Do not grieve; God is with us.\" The Prophet then prayed that he might be hindered and his horse sank with him up to its belly in hard ground. He said, \"I see that you two have prayed that I might be hindered; now pray for me, for God is on your side, that I may turn away the search from you.\" The Prophet prayed for him, and when he got free, he began to say whenever he met anyone, \"You have been saved trouble, for there is no one here; and he met no one without turning him back.\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

Tamim, came to him and said, \"Act equitably, messenger of God.\" He replied, \"Out upon you! Who will act equitably if I do not? You will be disappointed and losing if I do not act equitably.\" `Umar asked permission to cut off his head, but he replied, \"Leave him alone, for he has companions[1] in comparison with whose prayers any of you would despise his, and in comparison, with whose fasting any of you would despise his. They recite the Quran but it does not pass their collarbones. They swerve from the religion as an arrow goes through the animal aimed at. Their look is directed to its head, on to the sinew on its socket, on to its nadi, which is its rod, on to its feathers, but there is no sign of excrement or blood on it[2]. They will be recognised by the presence of a black man one of whose upper arms quivers like a woman's breast, or like a piece of meat, and they will revolt against the best section of mankind[3]. Abu Sa'id said: I testify that I heard this tradition from God's messenger, and I testify that `Ali b. Abu Talib fought with them and that I was with him. He gave orders about that man who was sought for, and when he was brought in and I looked at him, he was exactly as the Prophet had described him. A version has: A man with deep-set eyes, a projecting brow, a thick beard, high cheekbones and a shaven head came forward and said, \"Fear God, Muhammad.\" He replied, \"Who will obey God if I disobey Him? God entrusts me with power over the inhabitants of the earth but you[4] do not.\" A man asked to be allowed to kill him but he prevented him. Then when the man turned away, he said, \"From this one's stock there will be people who recite the Quran, yet it will not pass their throats. They will swerve from Islam as an arrow goes through the animal shot at. They will kill the followers of Islam and leave the worshippers of idols alone; but if I live to their time, I shall certainly kill them as `Ad were killed.\"\n1. People like him, or people at a later period who will acquire a reputation for piety. The reference is to the Kharijites.\n2. Just as an arrow can go through an animal without traces of excrement or blood, they will abandon Islam so quickly that no trace of it will be left in them.\n3. `Ali and his party.\n4. The pronoun is plural, indicating the man and his people.\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

When they came near where the monk was, they alighted and loosened their baggage, and the monk came out to them although when they had passed that way previously, he had not done so. While they were loosening their baggage the monk began to go about among them till he came and, taking God's messenger by the hand, said, \"This is the chief of the universe:\nthis is the messenger of the Lord of the universe whom God is commissioning as a mercy to the universe.\" Some shaikhs of Quraish asked him how he knew, and he replied, \"When you came over the hill not a tree or a stone failed to bow in prostration, and they prostrate themselves only before a prophet. I recognise him by the seal of prophecy, like an apple, below the end of his shoulder-blade.\" He then went and prepared food for them, and when he brought it to them the Prophet was looking after the camels, so he told them to send for him. He came with a cloud above him shading him, and when he approached the people, he found they had gone before him into the shade of a tree. Then when he sat down the shade of the tree inclined over him, and the monk said, \"Look how the shade of the tree has inclined over him. I adjure you by God to tell me which of you is his guardian.\" On being told that it was Abu Talib he kept adjuring him to send him back until he did so. Abu Bakr sent Bilal along with him and the monk gave him provision of coarse bread and olive-oil.\nTirmidhi transmitted it."

While we were travelling with him, we passed a camel being used for irrigation, and when the camel saw him, it rumbled and bent down its neck. The Prophet stopped beside it and asked where the owner of that camel was, and when he came, he asked him to sell it to him. He replied, \"No, I shall not give it to you, messenger of God, it belongs to a family which has no other means of livelihood.\" He said, \"Since you have mentioned this about it, note that it has complained to me of a great amount of work and a small amount of fodder; so, treat it well[*].\" We then travelled on, and when we came to a stage and the Prophet had lain down to sleep a tree came cleaving the earth till it overshadowed him and then returned to its place. When God's messenger awoke, I mentioned the m atter to him and he said, \"It is a tree which asked its Lord's permission to give a salutation to God's messenger, and He allowed it.\" We then travelled on, and when we passed a watering-place a woman brought a son of hers who was possessed, and the Prophet seized his nostril and said, \"Come out, for I am Muhammad, God's messenger.\" We then travelled on, and when we passed that watering-place on the way back he asked the woman about the boy and she said, \"I swear by Him who commissioned you with the truth that we have seen nothing in him to disturb us since you left.\"\n*The Prophet evidently had no desire to take the camel either by payment or as a gift, since it was the man's only means of earning a livelihood. He therefore left him with an exhortation to treat the camel properly.\nIt is transmitted in Sharh as-sunna."

God's messenger looked at a sheep at the side of the tent and said, \"What is this sheep, Umm Ma'bad?\" She replied, \"It is a sheep too emaciated to follow the flock.\" He asked if it had any milk, and when she replied that it was too exhausted for that, he asked if she would let him milk it. She said, \"You for whom I would give my father and mother as ransom, if you see anything to milk in it, milk it.\" God's messenger asked it to be brought, and wiping its udder with his hand and mentioning the name of God most high, he prayed that she might have a blessing in her sheep. It then opened its legs for him, gave a flow of milk and ruminated. He called for a vessel which could hold enough for the people and milked an abundant supply into it till the froth appeared on the top. He gave her a drink till she was satisfied and gave his companions a drink till they were satisfied, then drank himself last of all. Immediately afterwards he milked it a second time, and when he had filled the vessel, he left it with her. He contracted with her [to accept Islam] and they departed from her.\nIt is transmitted in Sharh as-sunna, by Ibn `Abd al-Barr in al-Isti'ab, and by Ibn al-Jauzi Kitab al-wafa'. In the tradition a story follows."

Abu Bakr said:\nThe people in the Suffa were poor men, and the Prophet said, \"Let him who has food for two take a third, and let him who has food for four take a fifth, or a sixth*.\" Abu Bakr brought three men and the Prophet went off with ten. Abu Bakr had supper with the Prophet, then remained till the evening prayer was said, after which he went back and stayed till the Prophet had had his supper. Then when so much of the night as God willed had passed, he came home and his wife asked what had kept him away from his guests. He asked if she had not given them their supper, and when she told him they had refused to take it till he came he was angry and said, \"I swear by God that I will never taste it.\" His wife swore that she would not taste it, and the guests swore that they would not taste it; so Abu Bakr, saying this came from the devil, called for the food and ate, and they ate also. Whenever they raised a morsel to their mouths the place from which it was taken increased in quantity, so Abu Bakr said to his wife, \"You who come from the B. Firas, what does this mean?\" She replied, \"I swear by my wellbeing that it is three times as great as it was.\" They ate and he sent it to the Prophet, and it is mentioned that he ate some of it.\n*It is not clear whether there is doubt about whether a fifth or a sixth is correct, or whether the words \"or a sixth\" indicate that two extra people may be invited when there is enough for four. The construction of the sentence rather suggests this latter meaning.\n(Bukhari and Muslim.)"

Muhammad said his father told that a man of Quraish came to visit his father, `Ali b. al-Husain[*], and suggested that he should tell him something about God's messenger. `Ali agreed that he would like to be told something about Abul Qasim, so he said:\nWhen God's messenger became ill Gabriel came to him and said, \"God has sent me to you, Muhammad, to show honour and regard specially for yourself and ask you about something He knows better than you, viz. how you are.\" He replied, \"I find myself, Gabriel, worried, and I find myself, Gabriel, full of care.\" Then he came to him next day and said that to him and the Prophet gave him the same reply as he had given the previous day. He came again on the third day and said the same as he had said on the first day, and he gave him the same reply. Along with him came an angel called Isma'il who was in command of a hundred thousand angels each of whom was in command of a hundred1, Ja'far as-Sadiq quotes his father Muhammad al-Baqir, who tells about his father 'Ali Zain al-'Abidin. thousand angels. He asked permission to enter, and when the Prophet asked about him Gabriel replied, \"This is the angel of death who is asking permission to come in to you, a thing he has never done to any human being before you and will never do to any human being after you.\" He told him to let him come in, and when that was done, he gave him a salutation and said, \"God has sent me to you, Muhammad, and if you order me to take your spirit I shall do so, but if you order me to leave it alone I shall do so.\" He asked, \"Will you do that, angel of death?\" and he replied, \"Yes, that is what I have been commanded, and I have been commanded to obey you.\" God's messenger then looked at Gabriel and Gabriel said, \"God has longed to meet you, Muhammad,\" so the Prophet said to the angel-of death, \"Go on with what you have been commanded,\" and he took his spirit. When God's messenger died and condolence came, they heard a voice from the corner of the house saying, \"Peace, God's mercy and blessings be upon you, members of the family. In God there is comfort for every calamity, a successor for everyone who perishes, and a recompense for everything which passes away, so by God's help guard yourselves and in Him place your hopes for the one who is smitten is he who is deprived of reward.\" `Ali then asked if they knew who this was and said it was al-Khidr.\n*Jafar as Sadiq quotes his father Muhammad al Baqir, who tells about his father, Ali Zain al Abidin.\nBaihaqi transmitted it in Dala'il an-nubuwa."

I swear by God that a people among whom you are reckoned the worst is a wicked people[2].\" A version has, ``a good people\". `Abdallah b. `Umar then moved on. When al-Hajjaj heard of 'Abdallah stopping and of what he had said, he sent and had Ibn az-Zubair taken down from his palm-trunk and cast among the graves of the Jews. He then sent for his mother, Asma' daughter of Abu Bakr, but she refused to go to him. He then sent the messenger back to say she must come, or he would send someone for her who would drag her by the hair. She refused to go saying, \"I swear by God that I shall not go to you till you send someone for me to drag me by my hair.\" He called for his smooth leather sandals, and taking them went off in a hurry[3]. Then when he went in to see her, he said, \"What do you think of the way I have dealt with God's enemy?\" She replied, \"I consider that you have spoiled his worldly interests and that he has spoiled your interests in the next world. I heard that you were addressing him as the son of the woman with two girdles. I swear by God that I am the woman with two girdles, one of which was used by me to tie up the food of God's messenger and of Abu Bakr out of reach of animals, and the other is the girdle with which no woman can dispense. God's messenger told us that Thaqif would have among them a great liar and one who would cause destruction, and I consider that the one who was to cause destruction is no other than you.\" He then got up and left her, and said no more to her.\n1. The reference is to Abdallah's dead body where he was crucified on the outskirts of Mecca.\n2. Mirqat, 5:515, explains this as meaning that a people who think such a good man to be the worst of them are indeed wicked. The version which follows gives a twist to the meaning, suggesting that a people among whom he is the worst must be very good.\n3. Or, swaggering.\nMuslim transmitted it."

God's messenger then said of his right hand, `This is `Uthman's hand,' and he struck his hands together saying, `This is for Uthman'.\" Ibn `Umar then said, `Go away now, and keep that with you.\"\n*When the Prophet came to al-Hadaibiya, he sent 'Uthman as an envoy to Mecca to explain that the Muslims desired to enter Mecca and perform the rites at the Ka'ba.

It was addressed from Hatib b. Abu Balta'a, to some of the polytheists in Mecca giving them some information about God's messenger. He asked, \"What is this, Hatib?\" and he replied, \"Messenger of God, do not be hasty with me. I have been a man attached as an ally to Quraish and not one of themselves, while those of the Emigrants who are with you have relationship to them by which they guard their property and family in Mecca. As I did not have that advantage by being of their stock, I wanted to give them some help for which they might guard my relations. I am not guilty of unbelief or apostasy from my religion, or of pleasure in infidelity after accepting Islam.\" God's messenger said, \"He has told you the truth,\" and `Umar said, \"Messenger of God, let me cut off this hypocrite's head.\" But God's messenger replied, \"He was present at Badr, and how do you know [he deserves this]? Perhaps God has looked with pity on those who were present at Badr and said, `Do what you wish,1 for paradise is guaranteed to you.'\" A version has \"You have been forgiven.\" God most high then sent down, \"You who believe, do not take my enemies and yours as friends[2].\"\nThis place was on the way from Medina to Mecca, presumably nearer Medina than Mecca.\nMirqat, 5:630, says this refers to a small or large amount of good deeds and supererogatory acts.

The Prophet meanwhile kept silent without speaking a word, so `Ammar wept and said, \"Messenger of God, do you not see him?\" The Prophet then raised his head and said, \"He who is hostile to `Ammar is hostile to God and he who hates `Ammar is hated by God.\" Khalid said: I then went out, and there was nothing dearer to me than 'Ammar's goodwill, so I treated him in a manner pleasing to him and he was well pleased. Abu `Ubaida told that he heard God's messenger say, \"Khalid is one of the swords of God who is great and glorious, and he is the fine warrior of the tribe.\"\n*Here the narrator of the tradition seems to take over the story till near the end where Khalid himself is again the speaker.\nAhmad transmitted the two traditions."

One day we had lunch with God's messenger, and Abu `Ubaida b. al-Jarrah who was along with us asked, \"Is anyone better, messenger of God, than we are who have accepted Islam and striven along with you?\" He replied, \"Yes, people who will come after your time and will believe on me without having seen me.\"\nHis name was Abdallah. He settled in Jerusalem and died in 99 A.H. See Shadharat adh dhahab, 1:116.\nIstiab p. 634, says there was doubt about his name, and one or two different statements about it are quoted. He was a companion of the Prophet and was reckoned among the Syrians.\nAhmad and Darimi transmitted it, and Razin transmitted it on Abu `Ubaida's authority from his asking, \"Is anyone better, messenger of God, than we are...\" to the end."
