Everlasting life without death!'\"There are many narrations such as this reported from the Prophet ﷺ mentioning Ar-Ru'yah (seeing Allah) and that the people will see their Lord, and mentioning the Foot and similar to these things. And the chosen approach concerning this with the people of\nknowledge from the A'immah such as Sufyãn Ath-Thawri, Mãlik bin Anas, Sufyan bin 'Uyainah, Ibn Al Mubãrak, Waki' and other than them, is that they report these narrations then say: \"We report these Hadith as they are, and we\nbelieve in them, and it is not to be said, 'how?\" \n\nThis is the path and approach which the people of Hadith have chosen - that they report these\nnarrations as they have come, they are believed in, they are not explained,1doubts are not to be cast upon them, and it is not to be said \"how?\" - This is the order of the people of knowledge which they chose and took as their approach.The meaning of his statement in the Hadith: \"And He will make them recognize Him\" is \"He manifests Himself to them in His Glory.\"1:That is, their \"how\" is not to be brought into question.","reference":"Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2557, Book 38, Hadith 35","grade":"Sahih.
