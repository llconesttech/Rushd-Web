And the angels will say: 'You have lied.'Allah will say to him: 'Rather, you wanted it to be said that so-and-so is a reciter. And that was said.' The person with the wealth will be brought, and Allah will say to him: 'Was I not so generous with you, such that I did not leave you having any need from anyone?' He will say: 'Of course O Lord!' He says: 'Then what did you do with what I gave to you?' He says: 'I would nurture the ties of kinship and give charity.' Then Allah will say to him: 'You have lied.' And the angels will say to him: 'You have lied.' Allah, Most High, will say: 'Rather, you wanted it to be said that so-and-so is so generous, and that was said.' Then the one who was killed in Allah's cause shall be brought, and Allah will say to him : 'For what were you killed?' So he says: 'I was commanded to fight in Your cause ,so I fought until I was killed.' Allah [Most High] will say to him: 'You have lied.' And the angels will say to him: 'You have lied.' Allah [Most High] will say: 'Rather, you wanted it be said that so-and-so is brave, and that was said.' \n\"Then the Messenger of Allah (s.a.w)hit me on my knees and said: 'O Abu Hurairah! These first three are the creatures of Allah with whom the fire will be enflamed on the Day of Judgement.'\"\nAl-Walid Abu 'Uthman Al-Mada'ini said: \"So 'Uqbah bin Muslim informed me that Shaufaiy, is the one who entered upon Mu'awiyah to inform him about this.\" Abu Uthman said: 'This has been done with these people, then how about with those who remain among the people?\" Then Mu'awiyah begin weeping so intensely, that we thought that he will kill himself with excessive weeping. We said: \"This man came to us to cause evil.\" Then Mu'awiyah recovered, wiped off his face and said: \"Allah and His Messenger told the truth: Whosoever desires the life of the world and its glitter, then we shall pay in full (the wages of) their deeds therein, and they shall have no diminution therein. They are those for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter Fire, and vain are the deeds they did therein. And of no effect is that which they used to do.\"","reference":"Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2382, Book 36, Hadith 79","grade":"Sahih(Darussalam)","question #":"question #6","question":"How does the hadith illustrate the potential dangers of hypocrisy in religious practices?","id":"tirmidhi-36-557"},{"hadith-eng":"\"Seven shall be shaded by Allah under his shade on a day in which there is no shade except His Shade: A just Imam, a young person raised upon worshiping  Allah, a man whose heart is attached to the Masjid when he leaves from it until he returns from it, two men who love each other for Allah's sake, coming together upon that, and parting upon that, a man who remembers Allah in privacy and his eyes swell with tears, a man invited by a woman of status and beauty, but he says: 'I fear Allah, Mighty and Sublime is He,' and a man who conceals the charity he gives such that his left hand does not know what his right hand has spent.\"","reference":"Jami` at-Tirmidhi 2391, Book 36, Hadith 88","grade":"Sahih(Darussalam)","question #":"question #6","question":"Why is it important to give charity discreetly in Islam?","id":"tirmidhi-36-558"},{"hadith-eng":"\"When Allah wants good for his slave, He hastens his punishment in the world.
