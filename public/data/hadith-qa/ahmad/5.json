She said to him: O `Abdullah bin Shaddad, will you tell me the truth about what I am going to ask you? Tell me about these people whom ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) killed. He said: Why shouldn`t I tell you the truth? She said: Tell me about them. He said: When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) corresponded with Mu`awiyah and the two arbitrators gave their verdict, eight thousand of the pious rebelled against him and camped in a land called Haroora`, near Koofah. They criticised him and said: You have taken off a chemise that Allah caused you to wear and a title that Allah gave to you, then you went ahead and asked people to issue a decree concerning the religion of Allah. There is no ruling except the ruling of Allah, may He be exalted. When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) heard about their criticism of him and the reason why they had split from him, he told his caller not to admit anyone but those who had memorised the Qur`an. When the house was filled with people who had memorised the Qur`an, he called for a large Mushaf and put it front of him, and he started tapping it with his hand, saying: O Mushaf, tell the people. The people called out: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, how could you ask it? It is only ink and paper, but we could speak on the basis of what we understand from it. What do you want? He said: These companions of yours who rebelled, between me and them is the Book of Allah, and Allah says in His Book concerning a woman and a man: `If you fear a breach between them twain (the man and his wife), appoint (two) arbitrators, one from his family and the other from hers; if they both wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation.` [an-Nisa 4:35]. The ummah of Muhammad is more important with regard to life and sanctity than a woman and a man. They got angry with me when I wrote a document between me and Mu`awiyah and wrote `Ali bin Abi Talib [without adding the title Ameer al-Mu`mineen]. But Suhail bin `Amr came to us when we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at al-Hudaibiyah, when he made a peace deal with Quraish, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote, `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.` Suhail said: Do not write, In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He said: What should we write? He said: Write: `In Your Name, O Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Write `Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).` He [Suhail] said: If I knew that you were the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I would not have opposed you. So he wrote: This is what was agreed by Muhammad bin `Abdullah with Quraish. And Allah says in His Book: “Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day` [Al-Ahzab 33:21]. So `Ali sent `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه) to them and I went out with him until we reached the middle of their camp. Ibnul-Kawwa` stood up and addressed the people, saying: O bearers of the Qur`an, this is `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه). Whoever does not know him, I know of the Book of Allah what can tell you about him, He is one of those concerning whom the words `they are a quarrelsome people` [Az-Zukhruf 43:58] were revealed. Tell him to go back to the one who sent him and do not discuss the Book of Allah with him. Their spokesmen stood up and said: By Allah, we will discuss the Book of Allah. If he says something sound and true that we recognise we will follow him, and if he says something false we will reject his false argument. So they discussed the Book with ‘Abdullah for three days, and four thousand of them recanted and all of them repented, including Ibnul-Kawwa`. He took them to `Ali in Koofah, and `Ali sent word to the rest of them, saying: You know the turmoil between us and our opponents. Stay wherever you wish until the ummah of Muhammad (ﷺ) is united. The deal between us and you is that you should not shed any blood that it is forbidden to shed or commit acts of banditry on the roads or do wrong to any Non Muslim under Muslim protection. If you do that, we will declare war, for Allah does not love those who betray. `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) said: O Ibn Shaddad, did he kill them? He said: By Allah, no sooner had he sent this message to them but they committed acts of banditry, shed blood and regarded it as permissible to harm Ahludh-Dhimmah (non-Muslims living under Muslim protection). She said: Do you swear by Allah? He said: I swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other god that this is what happened. She said: I have heard that the people of Iraq are talking and saying dhuth-thuda, dhuth-thuda [i.e., the one with a deformed arm that looks like a breast]. He said: I saw him and I was with ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) when he was examining the slain. He called the people and said: Do you know this one? How many of them came and said: I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so, and I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so. And there was no proof of who he was except that. She said: What did `Ali say when he stood over him, as the people of Iraq claim? He said: I heard him say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. She said: Did you hear him say anything other than that? He said: No, by Allah. She said: Yes, Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. May Allah have mercy on `Ali (رضي الله عنه): it was his habit, if he saw something he liked, to say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. But the people of Iraq fabricated lies against him and added words to what he said.","reference":"Musnad Ahmad 656, Book 5, Hadith 92","grade":"Hasan (Darussalam)](Darussalam)","question #":"question #1","question":"What was the reason for the rebellion against Ali (رضي الله عنه) by the group of eight thousand?","id":"ahmad-5-91"},{"hadith-eng":"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was at a funeral and he said: `which of you will go to the city and not leave in it any idol but he will break it, or any grave but he will level it, or any image but he will spoil it?` A man said: “I will, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).` So he went, but he was afraid of the people of the city, so he came back, `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: I will go, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).

The Prophet (ﷺ) was trying to find out about the well of Badr, and when we heard that the mushrikeen had come, the Messenger of Allah  (ﷺ) marched to Badr, and Badr was a well. We got there before the mushrikeen and we found two of their men, a man from Quraish and a freed slave of “Uqbah bin Abi Mu`ait. As for the Qurashi, he managed to escape, but we caught the freed slave of ‘Uqbah and started asking him: How many are the people? He said: By Allah, they are great in number and powerful. When he said that, the Muslims began to beat him and they brought him to the Prophet (ﷺ), who said: How many are the people? He said: By Allah, they are great in number and powerful. The Prophet (ﷺ) tried hard to make him tell him how many they were, but he refused. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) asked him: How many camels do they slaughter? He said: Ten each day. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: They are one thousand; each camel is for one hundred men. Then a shower of rain fell on us at night and we rushed to seek shelter beneath the trees and leather shields, sheltering from the rain. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) spent the night calling upon his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, saying: “O Allah, if You cause this band to be destroyed, You will never be worshipped.” When dawn came, he called out: `Prayer, O slaves of Allah!” And the people came from beneath the trees and shields and the Messenger of Allah led us in prayer and encouraged us to fight. Then he said: `The army of Quraish is beneath this red outcrop of the mountain.` When the people drew close to us, and we stood in ranks facing one another, we saw one of their men, riding a red camel of his, going around among the people. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `O `Ali, call Hamzah for me` - as he was the closest of them to the mushrikeen - and said `Who is the one on the red camel and what is he saying to them?` Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: `If there is anyone among the people who is enjoining good, then perhaps it is the one on the red camel.` Hamzah came and said: He is `Utbah bin Rabee`ah, and he is telling them not to fight; he is saying to them: O people, I can see people who are going to fight to the death and you will never be able to harm them, because it will cost you too dear to do so. O people, put the blame on me and say: `Utbah bin Rabee`ah is a coward, although you know that I am not the most cowardly among you. Abu Jahl heard that and said: Are you saying this? By Allah, if anyone else said this I would have insulted him; you are filled with fear, ‘Utbah said: Do you mean me, O you with the whistling rear end (i.e., one who breaks wind a great deal because of fear)? Today you will know which of us is the coward. Then ‘Utbah and his brother Shaibah and his son al-Waleed stepped forward in a display of courage and said: Who will come out to fight in single combat? Six young men of the Ansar stepped forward, but `Utbah said: We do not want these; let some of our cousins of Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib come out.

The Ansari said: I captured him, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: `Be quiet!

The protection offered by the least among them is to be honoured. They should be united as one against their enemies.

She said to him: O `Abdullah bin Shaddad, will you tell me the truth about what I am going to ask you? Tell me about these people whom ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) killed. He said: Why shouldn`t I tell you the truth? She said: Tell me about them. He said: When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) corresponded with Mu`awiyah and the two arbitrators gave their verdict, eight thousand of the pious rebelled against him and camped in a land called Haroora`, near Koofah. They criticised him and said: You have taken off a chemise that Allah caused you to wear and a title that Allah gave to you, then you went ahead and asked people to issue a decree concerning the religion of Allah. There is no ruling except the ruling of Allah, may He be exalted. When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) heard about their criticism of him and the reason why they had split from him, he told his caller not to admit anyone but those who had memorised the Qur`an. When the house was filled with people who had memorised the Qur`an, he called for a large Mushaf and put it front of him, and he started tapping it with his hand, saying: O Mushaf, tell the people. The people called out: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, how could you ask it? It is only ink and paper, but we could speak on the basis of what we understand from it. What do you want? He said: These companions of yours who rebelled, between me and them is the Book of Allah, and Allah says in His Book concerning a woman and a man: `If you fear a breach between them twain (the man and his wife), appoint (two) arbitrators, one from his family and the other from hers; if they both wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation.` [an-Nisa 4:35]. The ummah of Muhammad is more important with regard to life and sanctity than a woman and a man. They got angry with me when I wrote a document between me and Mu`awiyah and wrote `Ali bin Abi Talib [without adding the title Ameer al-Mu`mineen]. But Suhail bin `Amr came to us when we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at al-Hudaibiyah, when he made a peace deal with Quraish, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote, `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.` Suhail said: Do not write, In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He said: What should we write? He said: Write: `In Your Name, O Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Write `Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).` He [Suhail] said: If I knew that you were the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I would not have opposed you. So he wrote: This is what was agreed by Muhammad bin `Abdullah with Quraish. And Allah says in His Book: “Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day` [Al-Ahzab 33:21]. So `Ali sent `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه) to them and I went out with him until we reached the middle of their camp. Ibnul-Kawwa` stood up and addressed the people, saying: O bearers of the Qur`an, this is `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه). Whoever does not know him, I know of the Book of Allah what can tell you about him, He is one of those concerning whom the words `they are a quarrelsome people` [Az-Zukhruf 43:58] were revealed. Tell him to go back to the one who sent him and do not discuss the Book of Allah with him. Their spokesmen stood up and said: By Allah, we will discuss the Book of Allah. If he says something sound and true that we recognise we will follow him, and if he says something false we will reject his false argument. So they discussed the Book with ‘Abdullah for three days, and four thousand of them recanted and all of them repented, including Ibnul-Kawwa`. He took them to `Ali in Koofah, and `Ali sent word to the rest of them, saying: You know the turmoil between us and our opponents. Stay wherever you wish until the ummah of Muhammad (ﷺ) is united. The deal between us and you is that you should not shed any blood that it is forbidden to shed or commit acts of banditry on the roads or do wrong to any Non Muslim under Muslim protection. If you do that, we will declare war, for Allah does not love those who betray. `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) said: O Ibn Shaddad, did he kill them? He said: By Allah, no sooner had he sent this message to them but they committed acts of banditry, shed blood and regarded it as permissible to harm Ahludh-Dhimmah (non-Muslims living under Muslim protection). She said: Do you swear by Allah? He said: I swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other god that this is what happened. She said: I have heard that the people of Iraq are talking and saying dhuth-thuda, dhuth-thuda [i.e., the one with a deformed arm that looks like a breast]. He said: I saw him and I was with ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) when he was examining the slain. He called the people and said: Do you know this one? How many of them came and said: I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so, and I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so. And there was no proof of who he was except that. She said: What did `Ali say when he stood over him, as the people of Iraq claim? He said: I heard him say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. She said: Did you hear him say anything other than that? He said: No, by Allah. She said: Yes, Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. May Allah have mercy on `Ali (رضي الله عنه): it was his habit, if he saw something he liked, to say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. But the people of Iraq fabricated lies against him and added words to what he said.","reference":"Musnad Ahmad 656, Book 5, Hadith 92","grade":"Hasan (Darussalam)](Darussalam)","question #":"question #2","question":"How did Ali (رضي الله عنه) attempt to resolve the conflict with the rebels using the Quran?","id":"ahmad-5-860"},{"hadith-eng":"The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) was at a funeral and he said: `which of you will go to the city and not leave in it any idol but he will break it, or any grave but he will level it, or any image but he will spoil it?` A man said: “I will, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).` So he went, but he was afraid of the people of the city, so he came back, `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: I will go, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).

We got there before the mushrikeen and we found two of their men, a man from Quraish and a freed slave of “Uqbah bin Abi Mu`ait. As for the Qurashi, he managed to escape, but we caught the freed slave of ‘Uqbah and started asking him: How many are the people? He said: By Allah, they are great in number and powerful. When he said that, the Muslims began to beat him and they brought him to the Prophet (ﷺ), who said: How many are the people? He said: By Allah, they are great in number and powerful. The Prophet (ﷺ) tried hard to make him tell him how many they were, but he refused. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) asked him: How many camels do they slaughter? He said: Ten each day. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: They are one thousand; each camel is for one hundred men. Then a shower of rain fell on us at night and we rushed to seek shelter beneath the trees and leather shields, sheltering from the rain. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) spent the night calling upon his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, saying: “O Allah, if You cause this band to be destroyed, You will never be worshipped.” When dawn came, he called out: `Prayer, O slaves of Allah!” And the people came from beneath the trees and shields and the Messenger of Allah led us in prayer and encouraged us to fight. Then he said: `The army of Quraish is beneath this red outcrop of the mountain.` When the people drew close to us, and we stood in ranks facing one another, we saw one of their men, riding a red camel of his, going around among the people. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `O `Ali, call Hamzah for me` - as he was the closest of them to the mushrikeen - and said `Who is the one on the red camel and what is he saying to them?` Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: `If there is anyone among the people who is enjoining good, then perhaps it is the one on the red camel.` Hamzah came and said: He is `Utbah bin Rabee`ah, and he is telling them not to fight; he is saying to them: O people, I can see people who are going to fight to the death and you will never be able to harm them, because it will cost you too dear to do so. O people, put the blame on me and say: `Utbah bin Rabee`ah is a coward, although you know that I am not the most cowardly among you. Abu Jahl heard that and said: Are you saying this? By Allah, if anyone else said this I would have insulted him; you are filled with fear, ‘Utbah said: Do you mean me, O you with the whistling rear end (i.e., one who breaks wind a great deal because of fear)? Today you will know which of us is the coward. Then ‘Utbah and his brother Shaibah and his son al-Waleed stepped forward in a display of courage and said: Who will come out to fight in single combat?

She said to him: O `Abdullah bin Shaddad, will you tell me the truth about what I am going to ask you? Tell me about these people whom ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) killed. He said: Why shouldn`t I tell you the truth? She said: Tell me about them. He said: When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) corresponded with Mu`awiyah and the two arbitrators gave their verdict, eight thousand of the pious rebelled against him and camped in a land called Haroora`, near Koofah. They criticised him and said: You have taken off a chemise that Allah caused you to wear and a title that Allah gave to you, then you went ahead and asked people to issue a decree concerning the religion of Allah. There is no ruling except the ruling of Allah, may He be exalted. When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) heard about their criticism of him and the reason why they had split from him, he told his caller not to admit anyone but those who had memorised the Qur`an. When the house was filled with people who had memorised the Qur`an, he called for a large Mushaf and put it front of him, and he started tapping it with his hand, saying: O Mushaf, tell the people. The people called out: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, how could you ask it? It is only ink and paper, but we could speak on the basis of what we understand from it. What do you want? He said: These companions of yours who rebelled, between me and them is the Book of Allah, and Allah says in His Book concerning a woman and a man: `If you fear a breach between them twain (the man and his wife), appoint (two) arbitrators, one from his family and the other from hers; if they both wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation.` [an-Nisa 4:35]. The ummah of Muhammad is more important with regard to life and sanctity than a woman and a man. They got angry with me when I wrote a document between me and Mu`awiyah and wrote `Ali bin Abi Talib [without adding the title Ameer al-Mu`mineen]. But Suhail bin `Amr came to us when we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at al-Hudaibiyah, when he made a peace deal with Quraish, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote, `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.` Suhail said: Do not write, In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He said: What should we write? He said: Write: `In Your Name, O Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Write `Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).` He [Suhail] said: If I knew that you were the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I would not have opposed you. So he wrote: This is what was agreed by Muhammad bin `Abdullah with Quraish. And Allah says in His Book: “Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day` [Al-Ahzab 33:21]. So `Ali sent `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه) to them and I went out with him until we reached the middle of their camp. Ibnul-Kawwa` stood up and addressed the people, saying: O bearers of the Qur`an, this is `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه). Whoever does not know him, I know of the Book of Allah what can tell you about him, He is one of those concerning whom the words `they are a quarrelsome people` [Az-Zukhruf 43:58] were revealed. Tell him to go back to the one who sent him and do not discuss the Book of Allah with him. Their spokesmen stood up and said: By Allah, we will discuss the Book of Allah. If he says something sound and true that we recognise we will follow him, and if he says something false we will reject his false argument. So they discussed the Book with ‘Abdullah for three days, and four thousand of them recanted and all of them repented, including Ibnul-Kawwa`. He took them to `Ali in Koofah, and `Ali sent word to the rest of them, saying: You know the turmoil between us and our opponents. Stay wherever you wish until the ummah of Muhammad (ﷺ) is united. The deal between us and you is that you should not shed any blood that it is forbidden to shed or commit acts of banditry on the roads or do wrong to any Non Muslim under Muslim protection. If you do that, we will declare war, for Allah does not love those who betray. `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) said: O Ibn Shaddad, did he kill them? He said: By Allah, no sooner had he sent this message to them but they committed acts of banditry, shed blood and regarded it as permissible to harm Ahludh-Dhimmah (non-Muslims living under Muslim protection). She said: Do you swear by Allah? He said: I swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other god that this is what happened. She said: I have heard that the people of Iraq are talking and saying dhuth-thuda, dhuth-thuda [i.e., the one with a deformed arm that looks like a breast]. He said: I saw him and I was with ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) when he was examining the slain. He called the people and said: Do you know this one? How many of them came and said: I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so, and I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so. And there was no proof of who he was except that. She said: What did `Ali say when he stood over him, as the people of Iraq claim? He said: I heard him say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. She said: Did you hear him say anything other than that? He said: No, by Allah. She said: Yes, Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. May Allah have mercy on `Ali (رضي الله عنه): it was his habit, if he saw something he liked, to say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth.

The Prophet (ﷺ) was trying to find out about the well of Badr, and when we heard that the mushrikeen had come, the Messenger of Allah  (ﷺ) marched to Badr, and Badr was a well. We got there before the mushrikeen and we found two of their men, a man from Quraish and a freed slave of “Uqbah bin Abi Mu`ait. As for the Qurashi, he managed to escape, but we caught the freed slave of ‘Uqbah and started asking him: How many are the people? He said: By Allah, they are great in number and powerful. When he said that, the Muslims began to beat him and they brought him to the Prophet (ﷺ), who said: How many are the people? He said: By Allah, they are great in number and powerful. The Prophet (ﷺ) tried hard to make him tell him how many they were, but he refused. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) asked him: How many camels do they slaughter? He said: Ten each day. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: They are one thousand; each camel is for one hundred men. Then a shower of rain fell on us at night and we rushed to seek shelter beneath the trees and leather shields, sheltering from the rain. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) spent the night calling upon his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, saying: “O Allah, if You cause this band to be destroyed, You will never be worshipped.” When dawn came, he called out: `Prayer, O slaves of Allah!” And the people came from beneath the trees and shields and the Messenger of Allah led us in prayer and encouraged us to fight. Then he said: `The army of Quraish is beneath this red outcrop of the mountain.` When the people drew close to us, and we stood in ranks facing one another, we saw one of their men, riding a red camel of his, going around among the people. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `O `Ali, call Hamzah for me` - as he was the closest of them to the mushrikeen - and said `Who is the one on the red camel and what is he saying to them?` Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: `If there is anyone among the people who is enjoining good, then perhaps it is the one on the red camel.` Hamzah came and said: He is `Utbah bin Rabee`ah, and he is telling them not to fight; he is saying to them: O people, I can see people who are going to fight to the death and you will never be able to harm them, because it will cost you too dear to do so. O people, put the blame on me and say: `Utbah bin Rabee`ah is a coward, although you know that I am not the most cowardly among you. Abu Jahl heard that and said: Are you saying this? By Allah, if anyone else said this I would have insulted him; you are filled with fear, ‘Utbah said: Do you mean me, O you with the whistling rear end (i.e., one who breaks wind a great deal because of fear)? Today you will know which of us is the coward. Then ‘Utbah and his brother Shaibah and his son al-Waleed stepped forward in a display of courage and said: Who will come out to fight in single combat? Six young men of the Ansar stepped forward, but `Utbah said: We do not want these; let some of our cousins of Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib come out. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Get up, O Ali, get up, O Hamzah, get up, O `Ubaidah bin al-Harith bin ‘Abdul-Muttalib.` Allah caused `Utbah and Shaibah, the two sons of Rabee`ah, and al-Waleed bin ‘Utbah to be killed and ‘Ubaidah was wounded. We killed seventy of them and captured seventy. A short Ansari man brought al-Abbas bin `Abdul-Muttalib as a captive, and al-`Abbas said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), by Allah, this is not the one who captured me; I was captured by a bold man who was one of the most handsome of people, who was riding a piebald horse, but I do not see him among the people. The Ansari said: I captured him, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: `Be quiet!

She said to him: O `Abdullah bin Shaddad, will you tell me the truth about what I am going to ask you? Tell me about these people whom ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) killed. He said: Why shouldn`t I tell you the truth? She said: Tell me about them. He said: When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) corresponded with Mu`awiyah and the two arbitrators gave their verdict, eight thousand of the pious rebelled against him and camped in a land called Haroora`, near Koofah. They criticised him and said: You have taken off a chemise that Allah caused you to wear and a title that Allah gave to you, then you went ahead and asked people to issue a decree concerning the religion of Allah. There is no ruling except the ruling of Allah, may He be exalted. When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) heard about their criticism of him and the reason why they had split from him, he told his caller not to admit anyone but those who had memorised the Qur`an. When the house was filled with people who had memorised the Qur`an, he called for a large Mushaf and put it front of him, and he started tapping it with his hand, saying: O Mushaf, tell the people. The people called out: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, how could you ask it? It is only ink and paper, but we could speak on the basis of what we understand from it. What do you want? He said: These companions of yours who rebelled, between me and them is the Book of Allah, and Allah says in His Book concerning a woman and a man: `If you fear a breach between them twain (the man and his wife), appoint (two) arbitrators, one from his family and the other from hers; if they both wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation.` [an-Nisa 4:35]. The ummah of Muhammad is more important with regard to life and sanctity than a woman and a man. They got angry with me when I wrote a document between me and Mu`awiyah and wrote `Ali bin Abi Talib [without adding the title Ameer al-Mu`mineen]. But Suhail bin `Amr came to us when we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at al-Hudaibiyah, when he made a peace deal with Quraish, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote, `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.` Suhail said: Do not write, In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He said: What should we write? He said: Write: `In Your Name, O Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Write `Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).` He [Suhail] said: If I knew that you were the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I would not have opposed you. So he wrote: This is what was agreed by Muhammad bin `Abdullah with Quraish. And Allah says in His Book: “Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day` [Al-Ahzab 33:21]. So `Ali sent `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه) to them and I went out with him until we reached the middle of their camp. Ibnul-Kawwa` stood up and addressed the people, saying: O bearers of the Qur`an, this is `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه). Whoever does not know him, I know of the Book of Allah what can tell you about him, He is one of those concerning whom the words `they are a quarrelsome people` [Az-Zukhruf 43:58] were revealed. Tell him to go back to the one who sent him and do not discuss the Book of Allah with him. Their spokesmen stood up and said: By Allah, we will discuss the Book of Allah. If he says something sound and true that we recognise we will follow him, and if he says something false we will reject his false argument. So they discussed the Book with ‘Abdullah for three days, and four thousand of them recanted and all of them repented, including Ibnul-Kawwa`. He took them to `Ali in Koofah, and `Ali sent word to the rest of them, saying: You know the turmoil between us and our opponents. Stay wherever you wish until the ummah of Muhammad (ﷺ) is united. The deal between us and you is that you should not shed any blood that it is forbidden to shed or commit acts of banditry on the roads or do wrong to any Non Muslim under Muslim protection. If you do that, we will declare war, for Allah does not love those who betray. `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) said: O Ibn Shaddad, did he kill them? He said: By Allah, no sooner had he sent this message to them but they committed acts of banditry, shed blood and regarded it as permissible to harm Ahludh-Dhimmah (non-Muslims living under Muslim protection). She said: Do you swear by Allah? He said: I swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other god that this is what happened. She said: I have heard that the people of Iraq are talking and saying dhuth-thuda, dhuth-thuda [i.e., the one with a deformed arm that looks like a breast]. He said: I saw him and I was with ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) when he was examining the slain. He called the people and said: Do you know this one? How many of them came and said: I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so, and I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so. And there was no proof of who he was except that. She said: What did `Ali say when he stood over him, as the people of Iraq claim? He said: I heard him say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. She said: Did you hear him say anything other than that? He said: No, by Allah. She said: Yes, Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. May Allah have mercy on `Ali (رضي الله عنه): it was his habit, if he saw something he liked, to say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth.

The Prophet (ﷺ) was trying to find out about the well of Badr, and when we heard that the mushrikeen had come, the Messenger of Allah  (ﷺ) marched to Badr, and Badr was a well. We got there before the mushrikeen and we found two of their men, a man from Quraish and a freed slave of “Uqbah bin Abi Mu`ait. As for the Qurashi, he managed to escape, but we caught the freed slave of ‘Uqbah and started asking him: How many are the people? He said: By Allah, they are great in number and powerful. When he said that, the Muslims began to beat him and they brought him to the Prophet (ﷺ), who said: How many are the people? He said: By Allah, they are great in number and powerful. The Prophet (ﷺ) tried hard to make him tell him how many they were, but he refused. Then the Prophet (ﷺ) asked him: How many camels do they slaughter? He said: Ten each day. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: They are one thousand; each camel is for one hundred men. Then a shower of rain fell on us at night and we rushed to seek shelter beneath the trees and leather shields, sheltering from the rain. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) spent the night calling upon his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, saying: “O Allah, if You cause this band to be destroyed, You will never be worshipped.” When dawn came, he called out: `Prayer, O slaves of Allah!” And the people came from beneath the trees and shields and the Messenger of Allah led us in prayer and encouraged us to fight. Then he said: `The army of Quraish is beneath this red outcrop of the mountain.` When the people drew close to us, and we stood in ranks facing one another, we saw one of their men, riding a red camel of his, going around among the people. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `O `Ali, call Hamzah for me` - as he was the closest of them to the mushrikeen - and said `Who is the one on the red camel and what is he saying to them?` Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: `If there is anyone among the people who is enjoining good, then perhaps it is the one on the red camel.` Hamzah came and said: He is `Utbah bin Rabee`ah, and he is telling them not to fight; he is saying to them: O people, I can see people who are going to fight to the death and you will never be able to harm them, because it will cost you too dear to do so. O people, put the blame on me and say: `Utbah bin Rabee`ah is a coward, although you know that I am not the most cowardly among you. Abu Jahl heard that and said: Are you saying this? By Allah, if anyone else said this I would have insulted him; you are filled with fear, ‘Utbah said: Do you mean me, O you with the whistling rear end (i.e., one who breaks wind a great deal because of fear)? Today you will know which of us is the coward. Then ‘Utbah and his brother Shaibah and his son al-Waleed stepped forward in a display of courage and said: Who will come out to fight in single combat? Six young men of the Ansar stepped forward, but `Utbah said: We do not want these; let some of our cousins of Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib come out. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Get up, O Ali, get up, O Hamzah, get up, O `Ubaidah bin al-Harith bin ‘Abdul-Muttalib.` Allah caused `Utbah and Shaibah, the two sons of Rabee`ah, and al-Waleed bin ‘Utbah to be killed and ‘Ubaidah was wounded. We killed seventy of them and captured seventy. A short Ansari man brought al-Abbas bin `Abdul-Muttalib as a captive, and al-`Abbas said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), by Allah, this is not the one who captured me; I was captured by a bold man who was one of the most handsome of people, who was riding a piebald horse, but I do not see him among the people. The Ansari said: I captured him, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: `Be quiet! Allah, may He be exalted, supported you with a noble angel.` `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: We took prisoners, and from among Banu `Abdul-Muttalib, we captured al-`Abbas, ‘Aqeel and Nawfal bin al-Harith.","reference":"Musnad Ahmad 948, Book 5, Hadith 375","grade":"Lts isnad is Sahih](Darussalam)","question #":"question #4","question":"How did the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) handle the prisoners of war after the Battle of Badr?","id":"ahmad-5-2678"},{"hadith-eng":"I asked `A’ishah: Tell me about a man among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ)  whom I can ask about wiping over the khuffain.

She said to him: O `Abdullah bin Shaddad, will you tell me the truth about what I am going to ask you? Tell me about these people whom ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) killed. He said: Why shouldn`t I tell you the truth? She said: Tell me about them. He said: When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) corresponded with Mu`awiyah and the two arbitrators gave their verdict, eight thousand of the pious rebelled against him and camped in a land called Haroora`, near Koofah. They criticised him and said: You have taken off a chemise that Allah caused you to wear and a title that Allah gave to you, then you went ahead and asked people to issue a decree concerning the religion of Allah. There is no ruling except the ruling of Allah, may He be exalted. When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) heard about their criticism of him and the reason why they had split from him, he told his caller not to admit anyone but those who had memorised the Qur`an. When the house was filled with people who had memorised the Qur`an, he called for a large Mushaf and put it front of him, and he started tapping it with his hand, saying: O Mushaf, tell the people. The people called out: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, how could you ask it? It is only ink and paper, but we could speak on the basis of what we understand from it. What do you want? He said: These companions of yours who rebelled, between me and them is the Book of Allah, and Allah says in His Book concerning a woman and a man: `If you fear a breach between them twain (the man and his wife), appoint (two) arbitrators, one from his family and the other from hers; if they both wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation.` [an-Nisa 4:35]. The ummah of Muhammad is more important with regard to life and sanctity than a woman and a man. They got angry with me when I wrote a document between me and Mu`awiyah and wrote `Ali bin Abi Talib [without adding the title Ameer al-Mu`mineen]. But Suhail bin `Amr came to us when we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at al-Hudaibiyah, when he made a peace deal with Quraish, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote, `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.` Suhail said: Do not write, In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He said: What should we write? He said: Write: `In Your Name, O Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Write `Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).` He [Suhail] said: If I knew that you were the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I would not have opposed you. So he wrote: This is what was agreed by Muhammad bin `Abdullah with Quraish. And Allah says in His Book: “Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day` [Al-Ahzab 33:21]. So `Ali sent `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه) to them and I went out with him until we reached the middle of their camp. Ibnul-Kawwa` stood up and addressed the people, saying: O bearers of the Qur`an, this is `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه). Whoever does not know him, I know of the Book of Allah what can tell you about him, He is one of those concerning whom the words `they are a quarrelsome people` [Az-Zukhruf 43:58] were revealed. Tell him to go back to the one who sent him and do not discuss the Book of Allah with him. Their spokesmen stood up and said: By Allah, we will discuss the Book of Allah. If he says something sound and true that we recognise we will follow him, and if he says something false we will reject his false argument. So they discussed the Book with ‘Abdullah for three days, and four thousand of them recanted and all of them repented, including Ibnul-Kawwa`. He took them to `Ali in Koofah, and `Ali sent word to the rest of them, saying: You know the turmoil between us and our opponents. Stay wherever you wish until the ummah of Muhammad (ﷺ) is united. The deal between us and you is that you should not shed any blood that it is forbidden to shed or commit acts of banditry on the roads or do wrong to any Non Muslim under Muslim protection. If you do that, we will declare war, for Allah does not love those who betray. `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) said: O Ibn Shaddad, did he kill them? He said: By Allah, no sooner had he sent this message to them but they committed acts of banditry, shed blood and regarded it as permissible to harm Ahludh-Dhimmah (non-Muslims living under Muslim protection). She said: Do you swear by Allah? He said: I swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other god that this is what happened. She said: I have heard that the people of Iraq are talking and saying dhuth-thuda, dhuth-thuda [i.e., the one with a deformed arm that looks like a breast]. He said: I saw him and I was with ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) when he was examining the slain. He called the people and said: Do you know this one? How many of them came and said: I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so, and I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so. And there was no proof of who he was except that. She said: What did `Ali say when he stood over him, as the people of Iraq claim? He said: I heard him say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. She said: Did you hear him say anything other than that? He said: No, by Allah. She said: Yes, Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. May Allah have mercy on `Ali (رضي الله عنه): it was his habit, if he saw something he liked, to say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth.

Then he said: `The army of Quraish is beneath this red outcrop of the mountain.` When the people drew close to us, and we stood in ranks facing one another, we saw one of their men, riding a red camel of his, going around among the people. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `O `Ali, call Hamzah for me` - as he was the closest of them to the mushrikeen - and said `Who is the one on the red camel and what is he saying to them?` Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: `If there is anyone among the people who is enjoining good, then perhaps it is the one on the red camel.` Hamzah came and said: He is `Utbah bin Rabee`ah, and he is telling them not to fight; he is saying to them: O people, I can see people who are going to fight to the death and you will never be able to harm them, because it will cost you too dear to do so. O people, put the blame on me and say: `Utbah bin Rabee`ah is a coward, although you know that I am not the most cowardly among you. Abu Jahl heard that and said: Are you saying this? By Allah, if anyone else said this I would have insulted him; you are filled with fear, ‘Utbah said: Do you mean me, O you with the whistling rear end (i.e., one who breaks wind a great deal because of fear)? Today you will know which of us is the coward. Then ‘Utbah and his brother Shaibah and his son al-Waleed stepped forward in a display of courage and said: Who will come out to fight in single combat? Six young men of the Ansar stepped forward, but `Utbah said: We do not want these; let some of our cousins of Banu ‘Abdul-Muttalib come out. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Get up, O Ali, get up, O Hamzah, get up, O `Ubaidah bin al-Harith bin ‘Abdul-Muttalib.` Allah caused `Utbah and Shaibah, the two sons of Rabee`ah, and al-Waleed bin ‘Utbah to be killed and ‘Ubaidah was wounded. We killed seventy of them and captured seventy. A short Ansari man brought al-Abbas bin `Abdul-Muttalib as a captive, and al-`Abbas said: O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), by Allah, this is not the one who captured me; I was captured by a bold man who was one of the most handsome of people, who was riding a piebald horse, but I do not see him among the people. The Ansari said: I captured him, O Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). He said: `Be quiet! Allah, may He be exalted, supported you with a noble angel.` `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: We took prisoners, and from among Banu `Abdul-Muttalib, we captured al-`Abbas, ‘Aqeel and Nawfal bin al-Harith.","reference":"Musnad Ahmad 948, Book 5, Hadith 375","grade":"Lts isnad is Sahih](Darussalam)","question #":"question #5","question":"What was the significance of the rain that fell on the Muslim army before the Battle of Badr?","id":"ahmad-5-3413"},{"hadith-eng":"I asked `A’ishah: Tell me about a man among the Companions of the Prophet (ﷺ)  whom I can ask about wiping over the khuffain.

Did he take out anything from their humps? He said: He cut off their humps and took them away. `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: I looked at a sight that shocked me. I went to the Prophet (ﷺ), and Zaid bin Harithah was with him, and I told him what had happened. He went out, accompanied by Zaid, and I went with him. He entered upon Hamzah and expressed his anger to him. Hamzah looked up and said: Are you anything more than the slaves of my father? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) backed off until he departed from them. That was before the prohibition on alcohol.","reference":"Musnad Ahmad 1201, Book 5, Hadith 610","grade":"Sahih (Darussalam), al-Bukhari (2375) and Muslim (1979)](Darussalam)","question #":"question #5","question":"What were the social and economic activities of the companions of the Prophet (ﷺ) in Medina?","id":"ahmad-5-3623"},{"hadith-eng":"Some of the companions of `Ali (رضي الله عنه) said: Why don`t you tell us about the voluntary prayers that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) offered during the day? `Ali  (رضي الله عنه) said: By Allah, you cannot do it.

She said to him: O `Abdullah bin Shaddad, will you tell me the truth about what I am going to ask you? Tell me about these people whom ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه) killed. He said: Why shouldn`t I tell you the truth? She said: Tell me about them. He said: When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) corresponded with Mu`awiyah and the two arbitrators gave their verdict, eight thousand of the pious rebelled against him and camped in a land called Haroora`, near Koofah. They criticised him and said: You have taken off a chemise that Allah caused you to wear and a title that Allah gave to you, then you went ahead and asked people to issue a decree concerning the religion of Allah. There is no ruling except the ruling of Allah, may He be exalted. When `Ali (رضي الله عنه) heard about their criticism of him and the reason why they had split from him, he told his caller not to admit anyone but those who had memorised the Qur`an. When the house was filled with people who had memorised the Qur`an, he called for a large Mushaf and put it front of him, and he started tapping it with his hand, saying: O Mushaf, tell the people. The people called out: O Ameer al-Mu`mineen, how could you ask it? It is only ink and paper, but we could speak on the basis of what we understand from it. What do you want? He said: These companions of yours who rebelled, between me and them is the Book of Allah, and Allah says in His Book concerning a woman and a man: `If you fear a breach between them twain (the man and his wife), appoint (two) arbitrators, one from his family and the other from hers; if they both wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation.` [an-Nisa 4:35]. The ummah of Muhammad is more important with regard to life and sanctity than a woman and a man. They got angry with me when I wrote a document between me and Mu`awiyah and wrote `Ali bin Abi Talib [without adding the title Ameer al-Mu`mineen]. But Suhail bin `Amr came to us when we were with the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) at al-Hudaibiyah, when he made a peace deal with Quraish, and the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) wrote, `In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.` Suhail said: Do not write, In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He said: What should we write? He said: Write: `In Your Name, O Allah.” The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Write `Muhammad the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).` He [Suhail] said: If I knew that you were the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), I would not have opposed you. So he wrote: This is what was agreed by Muhammad bin `Abdullah with Quraish. And Allah says in His Book: “Indeed in the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) (Muhammad) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allah and the Last Day` [Al-Ahzab 33:21]. So `Ali sent `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه) to them and I went out with him until we reached the middle of their camp. Ibnul-Kawwa` stood up and addressed the people, saying: O bearers of the Qur`an, this is `Abdullah bin `Abbas (رضي الله عنه). Whoever does not know him, I know of the Book of Allah what can tell you about him, He is one of those concerning whom the words `they are a quarrelsome people` [Az-Zukhruf 43:58] were revealed. Tell him to go back to the one who sent him and do not discuss the Book of Allah with him. Their spokesmen stood up and said: By Allah, we will discuss the Book of Allah. If he says something sound and true that we recognise we will follow him, and if he says something false we will reject his false argument. So they discussed the Book with ‘Abdullah for three days, and four thousand of them recanted and all of them repented, including Ibnul-Kawwa`. He took them to `Ali in Koofah, and `Ali sent word to the rest of them, saying: You know the turmoil between us and our opponents. Stay wherever you wish until the ummah of Muhammad (ﷺ) is united. The deal between us and you is that you should not shed any blood that it is forbidden to shed or commit acts of banditry on the roads or do wrong to any Non Muslim under Muslim protection. If you do that, we will declare war, for Allah does not love those who betray. `A`ishah (رضي الله عنها) said: O Ibn Shaddad, did he kill them? He said: By Allah, no sooner had he sent this message to them but they committed acts of banditry, shed blood and regarded it as permissible to harm Ahludh-Dhimmah (non-Muslims living under Muslim protection). She said: Do you swear by Allah? He said: I swear by Allah besides Whom there is no other god that this is what happened.

How many of them came and said: I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so, and I saw him praying in the mosque of Banu So and so. And there was no proof of who he was except that. She said: What did `Ali say when he stood over him, as the people of Iraq claim? He said: I heard him say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. She said: Did you hear him say anything other than that? He said: No, by Allah. She said: Yes, Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. May Allah have mercy on `Ali (رضي الله عنه): it was his habit, if he saw something he liked, to say: Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth.
