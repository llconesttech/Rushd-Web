    "hadith-eng": "Abu Bakr bought a saddle from ‘Azib for thirteen dirhams, then Abu Bakr said to 'Azib. Tell al-Bara to carry it to my house. He said: No, not until you tell us what happened when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out and you were with him. Abu Bakr said: We started our journey at the beginning of the night and we hastened for one day and one night, until it was midday. I looked into the distance to see whether there was anywhere to seek shade, and I saw a rock, so I went to it and it had a little shade. I smoothed the ground for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and spread a garment of camel hair for him, and said: Lie down and rest, O Messenger of Allah. So he lay down, and I went out to see if I could spot anyone looking for us. Then I saw a shepherd and I said: Who do you belong to, O boy? He said: To a man of Quraish. He mentioned his name and I recognised it. I said: Is there any milk in your sheep? He said: Yes | said: Will you milk some for me? He said: Yes. I told him to do that, so he caught a sheep, then I told him to brush the dust from its teat, then to brush the dust off his hands. I had a small vessel with me on the neck of which was a cloth. He milked a little bit of milk for me and I poured it into the vessel until it cooled down. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When I reached him, he had already woken up. I said: Drink, O Messenger of Allah. He drank until I was pleased, then I said: Is it time to move on? So we moved on and the people were coming after us but none of them caught up with us except Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju'shum, who was riding a horse of his, I said: O Messenger of Allah, someone has caught up with us. He said: `Do not be afraid, for Allah is with us.` When he got close to us, and there was no more between us and him then the length of a spear or two or three spears, I said: O Messenger of Allah, this pursuer has caught up with us, and I wept. He said: `Why are you weeping?` I said: I am not weeping for myself; rather I am weeping for you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed against him [the pursuer] and said: “O Allah, protect us from him by whatever means You will.” Then his horse's legs sank into the solid ground up to its belly, and he fell off it. He said: O Muhammad, I know that this is because of you; pray to Allah to save me from my predicament, and by Allah I shall divert away from you any one who is behind me of those who are seeking you. Here is my quiver, take one arrow. You are going to pass by some camels and sheep of mine in such and such a place, take whatever you need from thern. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `I have no need of it.“ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed for him and he was released, and he went back to his companions. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and I continued on our way until we came to Madinah, where the people met him. They came out on the road and on the roofs, and a lot of servants and children crowded the road saying: Allahu Akbar, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has come, Muhammad has come. The people disputed as to who he would stay with. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Tonight I will stay with Banun-Najjar, the maternal uncles of 'Abdul-Muttalib, to honour them thereby.” The next morning, he went where he was instructed. Al-Bara' bin 'Azib said: The first of the Muhajireen to come to us was Mus'ab bin 'Umair, the brother of Banu 'Abdud-Dar. Then Ibn Umm Maktoom, the blind man and brother of Banu Fihr, came to us. Then 'Umar bin al-Khattab, came to us with twenty riders and we said: What happened to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? He said: He is behind me. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came and Abu Bakr was with him. Al-Bara said: the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not come until I had read some soorahs from al-Mufassal [Al-Mufassal is that portion of the Qur'an which goes from Qaf to an-Nas]. Isra'eel said: al-Bara' was one of the Ansar from Banu Harithah.",

Then he sat where he was until he had prayed Zuhr, 'Asr and Maghrib, and he did not speak until he had prayed 'isha'. Then he got up and went to his family. The people said to Abu Bakr: Why don't you ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) what is the matter? He did something today that he never did before. So he asked him and he said: `Yes, I was shown what is to come of this world and the Hereafter. The earlier and later generations were gathered in one place and the people got terrified because of that. They went to Adam when the sweat was about to reach their mouths, and they said: O Adam, you are the father of mankind and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose you. Intercede for us with your Lord, He said: I am in the same position as you. Go to your father after your father, to Nooh, “Allah chose Adam, Nooh (Noah), the family of Ibraheem (Abraham) and the family of 'Imran above the 'Alameen (mankind and jinn) (of their times)` (Al 'Imran 3:33}.\n\nThen they will go to Nooh and will say: Intercede with your Lord for us, for Allah chose you and answered your supplication, and He did not leave one of the disbelievers on the Earth (cf. 71:26). He will say: I am not the one you want; go to Ibraheem for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, took him as a close friend (khaleel). So they will go to Ibraheem but he will say: I am not the one you want; go to Moosa, for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, spoke directly to him (cf. 4:164). But Moosa will say: I am not the one you want; go to 'Eesa Ibn Maryam, for he healed those born blind and the lepers, and he brought forth the dead. But 'Eesa will say: I am not the one you want; go to the leader of the sons of Adam, for he is the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection. Go to Muhammad, for he will intercede for you with your Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. Then (the Prophet) will go and Jibreel will come to his Lord and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Give him permission and give him the glad tidings of Paradise. Jibreel will take him and he will fall down in prostration for a week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intercession will be accepted. So he will raise his head, and when he looks at his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, he will fall down in prostration for another week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intersession will be accepted. He will start to fall down in prostration again, but Jibreel (peace be upon him) will take hold of his upper arms and Allah, may he be glorified and exalted, will inspire him to offer a supplication such as no human being was ever inspired with. He will say: `O Lord, You created me as the leader of the sons of Adam, and no boast; the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection, and no boast; there will come to my Cistern more people than there can be between San‘a’ and Allah (Eilat).` Then it will be said: Call the Siddeeq's so that they might intercede. Then it will be said: Call the Prophets. So one Prophet will come with a group, and another Prophet will come with five or six people, and another Prophet will come with nobody. Then it will be said: Call the martyrs so that they might intercede for whoever they want. When the martyrs do that, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: I am the Most Merciful of those who show mercy; I admit to My Paradise anyone who does not associate anything with Me.\n\nSo they will enter Paradise. Then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look in Hell; can you find anyone who ever did anything good? And they will find a man in Hell, and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that I was easy-going with people in buying and selling. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Be easy-going with My slave as he was easygoing with My slaves. Then they will bring a man out of Hell and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that l instructed my sons: When I die, burn me with fire, then grind me until I am like kohl powder. Then take me to the sea and scatter me in the wind, for by Allah the Lord of the Worlds will never be able to punish me. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Why did you do that? He will say: For fear of You. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look at the kingdom of the greatest king and you will have the like thereof and ten times as much. He will say: Are You making fun of me when You are the Sovereign? He (the Prophet (ﷺ) said: “That is what I was smiling at, at the time of the foremoon.`",

Whoever among the Muslims is asked to pay it in the proper manner, let him give it; whoever is asked for more than that, let him not give it. For less than twenty-five camels, for each five, one sheep (should be given). If the number reaches twenty-five, then one she-camel in its second year (should be given), up to thirty-five. If there is no she-camel in its second year, then a he-camel in its third year (may be given). If the number reaches thirty-six, then a she-camel in its third year (should be given), up to forty-five. If the number reaches forty-six, then a she-camel in its fourth year that has been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to sixty, If the number reaches sixty-one, then a she-camel in its fifth year (should be given), up to seventy five. If the number reaches seventy-six, then two she-camels in their second year (should be given), up to ninety. If the number reaches ninety-one, then two she camels in their fourth year that have been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to one hundred and twenty. If the number is more than one hundred and twenty, then for every forty camels, a she-camel limits third year should be given and for every fifty a she-camel in its fourth year. If the ages of the camels for zakah differ, if what is due is a she-camel in its fifth year but he does not own such a camel, but he has a she-camel in its fourth year, then that will be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, if available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she-camel in its fourth year and he only has a she camel in its fifth year, it should be accepted from him and the zakat collector should give him back twenty dirhams or two sheep. If what is due from him is a shecamel in its fourth year, but he does not have such a cameland he has a she-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, is available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she camel in its second year, but he only has a he-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and nothing should be added to it. If he has only four camels, no zakah is due unless the owner wants to give it. With regard to zakah on sheep in the pasture, if there are forty sheep, then one sheep is due as zakah, up to one hundred and twenty sheep. of there is one more than that, then two sheep are due, up to two hundred. If there is one more than that then three sheep are due, up to three hundred. If there is one more than that, then for every hundred sheep, one sheep is due No toothless or defective sheep should be taken as zakah and neither should a ram, unless the one who is giving allows that. Separate flocks should not be put together and flocks should not be divided so as to avoid or reduce zakah. If there are two partners [and the zakah-collector comes and takes zakah), they should settle the matter between them on a fair basis. If a man's flock is grazing if it is one less than forty, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it. On silver the zakah is one quarter of one tenth; if the wealth is only one hundred and ninety dirhams, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it.",

Abu Bakr said: We started our journey at the beginning of the night and we hastened for one day and one night, until it was midday. I looked into the distance to see whether there was anywhere to seek shade, and I saw a rock, so I went to it and it had a little shade. I smoothed the ground for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and spread a garment of camel hair for him, and said: Lie down and rest, O Messenger of Allah. So he lay down, and I went out to see if I could spot anyone looking for us. Then I saw a shepherd and I said: Who do you belong to, O boy? He said: To a man of Quraish. He mentioned his name and I recognised it. I said: Is there any milk in your sheep? He said: Yes | said: Will you milk some for me? He said: Yes. I told him to do that, so he caught a sheep, then I told him to brush the dust from its teat, then to brush the dust off his hands. I had a small vessel with me on the neck of which was a cloth. He milked a little bit of milk for me and I poured it into the vessel until it cooled down. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When I reached him, he had already woken up. I said: Drink, O Messenger of Allah. He drank until I was pleased, then I said: Is it time to move on? So we moved on and the people were coming after us but none of them caught up with us except Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju'shum, who was riding a horse of his, I said: O Messenger of Allah, someone has caught up with us. He said: `Do not be afraid, for Allah is with us.` When he got close to us, and there was no more between us and him then the length of a spear or two or three spears, I said: O Messenger of Allah, this pursuer has caught up with us, and I wept. He said: `Why are you weeping?` I said: I am not weeping for myself; rather I am weeping for you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed against him [the pursuer] and said: “O Allah, protect us from him by whatever means You will.” Then his horse's legs sank into the solid ground up to its belly, and he fell off it. He said: O Muhammad, I know that this is because of you; pray to Allah to save me from my predicament, and by Allah I shall divert away from you any one who is behind me of those who are seeking you. Here is my quiver, take one arrow. You are going to pass by some camels and sheep of mine in such and such a place, take whatever you need from thern.

They came out on the road and on the roofs, and a lot of servants and children crowded the road saying: Allahu Akbar, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has come, Muhammad has come. The people disputed as to who he would stay with.

Then he sat where he was until he had prayed Zuhr, 'Asr and Maghrib, and he did not speak until he had prayed 'isha'. Then he got up and went to his family. The people said to Abu Bakr: Why don't you ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) what is the matter? He did something today that he never did before. So he asked him and he said: `Yes, I was shown what is to come of this world and the Hereafter. The earlier and later generations were gathered in one place and the people got terrified because of that. They went to Adam when the sweat was about to reach their mouths, and they said: O Adam, you are the father of mankind and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose you. Intercede for us with your Lord, He said: I am in the same position as you. Go to your father after your father, to Nooh, “Allah chose Adam, Nooh (Noah), the family of Ibraheem (Abraham) and the family of 'Imran above the 'Alameen (mankind and jinn) (of their times)` (Al 'Imran 3:33}.\n\nThen they will go to Nooh and will say: Intercede with your Lord for us, for Allah chose you and answered your supplication, and He did not leave one of the disbelievers on the Earth (cf. 71:26). He will say: I am not the one you want; go to Ibraheem for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, took him as a close friend (khaleel). So they will go to Ibraheem but he will say: I am not the one you want; go to Moosa, for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, spoke directly to him (cf. 4:164). But Moosa will say: I am not the one you want; go to 'Eesa Ibn Maryam, for he healed those born blind and the lepers, and he brought forth the dead. But 'Eesa will say: I am not the one you want; go to the leader of the sons of Adam, for he is the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection. Go to Muhammad, for he will intercede for you with your Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. Then (the Prophet) will go and Jibreel will come to his Lord and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Give him permission and give him the glad tidings of Paradise. Jibreel will take him and he will fall down in prostration for a week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intercession will be accepted. So he will raise his head, and when he looks at his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, he will fall down in prostration for another week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intersession will be accepted. He will start to fall down in prostration again, but Jibreel (peace be upon him) will take hold of his upper arms and Allah, may he be glorified and exalted, will inspire him to offer a supplication such as no human being was ever inspired with. He will say: `O Lord, You created me as the leader of the sons of Adam, and no boast; the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection, and no boast; there will come to my Cistern more people than there can be between San‘a’ and Allah (Eilat).` Then it will be said: Call the Siddeeq's so that they might intercede. Then it will be said: Call the Prophets. So one Prophet will come with a group, and another Prophet will come with five or six people, and another Prophet will come with nobody. Then it will be said: Call the martyrs so that they might intercede for whoever they want. When the martyrs do that, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: I am the Most Merciful of those who show mercy; I admit to My Paradise anyone who does not associate anything with Me.\n\nSo they will enter Paradise. Then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look in Hell; can you find anyone who ever did anything good? And they will find a man in Hell, and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that I was easy-going with people in buying and selling. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Be easy-going with My slave as he was easygoing with My slaves. Then they will bring a man out of Hell and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that l instructed my sons: When I die, burn me with fire, then grind me until I am like kohl powder. Then take me to the sea and scatter me in the wind, for by Allah the Lord of the Worlds will never be able to punish me. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Why did you do that? He will say: For fear of You. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look at the kingdom of the greatest king and you will have the like thereof and ten times as much. He will say: Are You making fun of me when You are the Sovereign? He (the Prophet (ﷺ) said: “That is what I was smiling at, at the time of the foremoon.`",

Whoever among the Muslims is asked to pay it in the proper manner, let him give it; whoever is asked for more than that, let him not give it. For less than twenty-five camels, for each five, one sheep (should be given). If the number reaches twenty-five, then one she-camel in its second year (should be given), up to thirty-five. If there is no she-camel in its second year, then a he-camel in its third year (may be given). If the number reaches thirty-six, then a she-camel in its third year (should be given), up to forty-five. If the number reaches forty-six, then a she-camel in its fourth year that has been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to sixty, If the number reaches sixty-one, then a she-camel in its fifth year (should be given), up to seventy five. If the number reaches seventy-six, then two she-camels in their second year (should be given), up to ninety. If the number reaches ninety-one, then two she camels in their fourth year that have been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to one hundred and twenty. If the number is more than one hundred and twenty, then for every forty camels, a she-camel limits third year should be given and for every fifty a she-camel in its fourth year. If the ages of the camels for zakah differ, if what is due is a she-camel in its fifth year but he does not own such a camel, but he has a she-camel in its fourth year, then that will be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, if available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she-camel in its fourth year and he only has a she camel in its fifth year, it should be accepted from him and the zakat collector should give him back twenty dirhams or two sheep. If what is due from him is a shecamel in its fourth year, but he does not have such a cameland he has a she-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, is available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she camel in its second year, but he only has a he-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and nothing should be added to it. If he has only four camels, no zakah is due unless the owner wants to give it. With regard to zakah on sheep in the pasture, if there are forty sheep, then one sheep is due as zakah, up to one hundred and twenty sheep. of there is one more than that, then two sheep are due, up to two hundred. If there is one more than that then three sheep are due, up to three hundred. If there is one more than that, then for every hundred sheep, one sheep is due No toothless or defective sheep should be taken as zakah and neither should a ram, unless the one who is giving allows that. Separate flocks should not be put together and flocks should not be divided so as to avoid or reduce zakah. If there are two partners [and the zakah-collector comes and takes zakah), they should settle the matter between them on a fair basis. If a man's flock is grazing if it is one less than forty, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it. On silver the zakah is one quarter of one tenth; if the wealth is only one hundred and ninety dirhams, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it.",

Abu Bakr said: We started our journey at the beginning of the night and we hastened for one day and one night, until it was midday. I looked into the distance to see whether there was anywhere to seek shade, and I saw a rock, so I went to it and it had a little shade. I smoothed the ground for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and spread a garment of camel hair for him, and said: Lie down and rest, O Messenger of Allah. So he lay down, and I went out to see if I could spot anyone looking for us. Then I saw a shepherd and I said: Who do you belong to, O boy? He said: To a man of Quraish. He mentioned his name and I recognised it. I said: Is there any milk in your sheep? He said: Yes | said: Will you milk some for me? He said: Yes. I told him to do that, so he caught a sheep, then I told him to brush the dust from its teat, then to brush the dust off his hands. I had a small vessel with me on the neck of which was a cloth. He milked a little bit of milk for me and I poured it into the vessel until it cooled down. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When I reached him, he had already woken up. I said: Drink, O Messenger of Allah. He drank until I was pleased, then I said: Is it time to move on? So we moved on and the people were coming after us but none of them caught up with us except Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju'shum, who was riding a horse of his, I said: O Messenger of Allah, someone has caught up with us. He said: `Do not be afraid, for Allah is with us.` When he got close to us, and there was no more between us and him then the length of a spear or two or three spears, I said: O Messenger of Allah, this pursuer has caught up with us, and I wept. He said: `Why are you weeping?` I said: I am not weeping for myself; rather I am weeping for you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed against him [the pursuer] and said: “O Allah, protect us from him by whatever means You will.” Then his horse's legs sank into the solid ground up to its belly, and he fell off it. He said: O Muhammad, I know that this is because of you; pray to Allah to save me from my predicament, and by Allah I shall divert away from you any one who is behind me of those who are seeking you. Here is my quiver, take one arrow. You are going to pass by some camels and sheep of mine in such and such a place, take whatever you need from thern.

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and I continued on our way until we came to Madinah, where the people met him. They came out on the road and on the roofs, and a lot of servants and children crowded the road saying: Allahu Akbar, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has come, Muhammad has come. The people disputed as to who he would stay with. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Tonight I will stay with Banun-Najjar, the maternal uncles of 'Abdul-Muttalib, to honour them thereby.” The next morning, he went where he was instructed. Al-Bara' bin 'Azib said: The first of the Muhajireen to come to us was Mus'ab bin 'Umair, the brother of Banu 'Abdud-Dar. Then Ibn Umm Maktoom, the blind man and brother of Banu Fihr, came to us.

Then he sat where he was until he had prayed Zuhr, 'Asr and Maghrib, and he did not speak until he had prayed 'isha'. Then he got up and went to his family. The people said to Abu Bakr: Why don't you ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) what is the matter? He did something today that he never did before. So he asked him and he said: `Yes, I was shown what is to come of this world and the Hereafter. The earlier and later generations were gathered in one place and the people got terrified because of that. They went to Adam when the sweat was about to reach their mouths, and they said: O Adam, you are the father of mankind and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose you. Intercede for us with your Lord, He said: I am in the same position as you. Go to your father after your father, to Nooh, “Allah chose Adam, Nooh (Noah), the family of Ibraheem (Abraham) and the family of 'Imran above the 'Alameen (mankind and jinn) (of their times)` (Al 'Imran 3:33}.\n\nThen they will go to Nooh and will say: Intercede with your Lord for us, for Allah chose you and answered your supplication, and He did not leave one of the disbelievers on the Earth (cf. 71:26). He will say: I am not the one you want; go to Ibraheem for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, took him as a close friend (khaleel). So they will go to Ibraheem but he will say: I am not the one you want; go to Moosa, for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, spoke directly to him (cf. 4:164). But Moosa will say: I am not the one you want; go to 'Eesa Ibn Maryam, for he healed those born blind and the lepers, and he brought forth the dead. But 'Eesa will say: I am not the one you want; go to the leader of the sons of Adam, for he is the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection. Go to Muhammad, for he will intercede for you with your Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. Then (the Prophet) will go and Jibreel will come to his Lord and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Give him permission and give him the glad tidings of Paradise. Jibreel will take him and he will fall down in prostration for a week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intercession will be accepted. So he will raise his head, and when he looks at his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, he will fall down in prostration for another week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intersession will be accepted. He will start to fall down in prostration again, but Jibreel (peace be upon him) will take hold of his upper arms and Allah, may he be glorified and exalted, will inspire him to offer a supplication such as no human being was ever inspired with. He will say: `O Lord, You created me as the leader of the sons of Adam, and no boast; the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection, and no boast; there will come to my Cistern more people than there can be between San‘a’ and Allah (Eilat).` Then it will be said: Call the Siddeeq's so that they might intercede. Then it will be said: Call the Prophets. So one Prophet will come with a group, and another Prophet will come with five or six people, and another Prophet will come with nobody. Then it will be said: Call the martyrs so that they might intercede for whoever they want. When the martyrs do that, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: I am the Most Merciful of those who show mercy; I admit to My Paradise anyone who does not associate anything with Me.\n\nSo they will enter Paradise. Then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look in Hell; can you find anyone who ever did anything good? And they will find a man in Hell, and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that I was easy-going with people in buying and selling. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Be easy-going with My slave as he was easygoing with My slaves. Then they will bring a man out of Hell and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that l instructed my sons: When I die, burn me with fire, then grind me until I am like kohl powder. Then take me to the sea and scatter me in the wind, for by Allah the Lord of the Worlds will never be able to punish me. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Why did you do that? He will say: For fear of You. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look at the kingdom of the greatest king and you will have the like thereof and ten times as much. He will say: Are You making fun of me when You are the Sovereign? He (the Prophet (ﷺ) said: “That is what I was smiling at, at the time of the foremoon.`",

For less than twenty-five camels, for each five, one sheep (should be given). If the number reaches twenty-five, then one she-camel in its second year (should be given), up to thirty-five. If there is no she-camel in its second year, then a he-camel in its third year (may be given). If the number reaches thirty-six, then a she-camel in its third year (should be given), up to forty-five. If the number reaches forty-six, then a she-camel in its fourth year that has been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to sixty, If the number reaches sixty-one, then a she-camel in its fifth year (should be given), up to seventy five. If the number reaches seventy-six, then two she-camels in their second year (should be given), up to ninety. If the number reaches ninety-one, then two she camels in their fourth year that have been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to one hundred and twenty. If the number is more than one hundred and twenty, then for every forty camels, a she-camel limits third year should be given and for every fifty a she-camel in its fourth year. If the ages of the camels for zakah differ, if what is due is a she-camel in its fifth year but he does not own such a camel, but he has a she-camel in its fourth year, then that will be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, if available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she-camel in its fourth year and he only has a she camel in its fifth year, it should be accepted from him and the zakat collector should give him back twenty dirhams or two sheep. If what is due from him is a shecamel in its fourth year, but he does not have such a cameland he has a she-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, is available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she camel in its second year, but he only has a he-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and nothing should be added to it. If he has only four camels, no zakah is due unless the owner wants to give it. With regard to zakah on sheep in the pasture, if there are forty sheep, then one sheep is due as zakah, up to one hundred and twenty sheep. of there is one more than that, then two sheep are due, up to two hundred. If there is one more than that then three sheep are due, up to three hundred. If there is one more than that, then for every hundred sheep, one sheep is due No toothless or defective sheep should be taken as zakah and neither should a ram, unless the one who is giving allows that. Separate flocks should not be put together and flocks should not be divided so as to avoid or reduce zakah. If there are two partners [and the zakah-collector comes and takes zakah), they should settle the matter between them on a fair basis. If a man's flock is grazing if it is one less than forty, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it.

He said: No, not until you tell us what happened when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out and you were with him. Abu Bakr said: We started our journey at the beginning of the night and we hastened for one day and one night, until it was midday. I looked into the distance to see whether there was anywhere to seek shade, and I saw a rock, so I went to it and it had a little shade. I smoothed the ground for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and spread a garment of camel hair for him, and said: Lie down and rest, O Messenger of Allah. So he lay down, and I went out to see if I could spot anyone looking for us. Then I saw a shepherd and I said: Who do you belong to, O boy? He said: To a man of Quraish. He mentioned his name and I recognised it. I said: Is there any milk in your sheep? He said: Yes | said: Will you milk some for me? He said: Yes. I told him to do that, so he caught a sheep, then I told him to brush the dust from its teat, then to brush the dust off his hands. I had a small vessel with me on the neck of which was a cloth. He milked a little bit of milk for me and I poured it into the vessel until it cooled down. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When I reached him, he had already woken up. I said: Drink, O Messenger of Allah. He drank until I was pleased, then I said: Is it time to move on? So we moved on and the people were coming after us but none of them caught up with us except Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju'shum, who was riding a horse of his, I said: O Messenger of Allah, someone has caught up with us. He said: `Do not be afraid, for Allah is with us.` When he got close to us, and there was no more between us and him then the length of a spear or two or three spears, I said: O Messenger of Allah, this pursuer has caught up with us, and I wept. He said: `Why are you weeping?` I said: I am not weeping for myself; rather I am weeping for you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed against him [the pursuer] and said: “O Allah, protect us from him by whatever means You will.” Then his horse's legs sank into the solid ground up to its belly, and he fell off it. He said: O Muhammad, I know that this is because of you; pray to Allah to save me from my predicament, and by Allah I shall divert away from you any one who is behind me of those who are seeking you. Here is my quiver, take one arrow. You are going to pass by some camels and sheep of mine in such and such a place, take whatever you need from thern. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `I have no need of it.“ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed for him and he was released, and he went back to his companions. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and I continued on our way until we came to Madinah, where the people met him. They came out on the road and on the roofs, and a lot of servants and children crowded the road saying: Allahu Akbar, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has come, Muhammad has come. The people disputed as to who he would stay with. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Tonight I will stay with Banun-Najjar, the maternal uncles of 'Abdul-Muttalib, to honour them thereby.” The next morning, he went where he was instructed. Al-Bara' bin 'Azib said: The first of the Muhajireen to come to us was Mus'ab bin 'Umair, the brother of Banu 'Abdud-Dar. Then Ibn Umm Maktoom, the blind man and brother of Banu Fihr, came to us. Then 'Umar bin al-Khattab, came to us with twenty riders and we said: What happened to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? He said: He is behind me. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came and Abu Bakr was with him. Al-Bara said: the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not come until I had read some soorahs from al-Mufassal [Al-Mufassal is that portion of the Qur'an which goes from Qaf to an-Nas].

The people said to Abu Bakr: Why don't you ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) what is the matter? He did something today that he never did before. So he asked him and he said: `Yes, I was shown what is to come of this world and the Hereafter. The earlier and later generations were gathered in one place and the people got terrified because of that. They went to Adam when the sweat was about to reach their mouths, and they said: O Adam, you are the father of mankind and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose you. Intercede for us with your Lord, He said: I am in the same position as you. Go to your father after your father, to Nooh, “Allah chose Adam, Nooh (Noah), the family of Ibraheem (Abraham) and the family of 'Imran above the 'Alameen (mankind and jinn) (of their times)` (Al 'Imran 3:33}.\n\nThen they will go to Nooh and will say: Intercede with your Lord for us, for Allah chose you and answered your supplication, and He did not leave one of the disbelievers on the Earth (cf. 71:26). He will say: I am not the one you want; go to Ibraheem for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, took him as a close friend (khaleel). So they will go to Ibraheem but he will say: I am not the one you want; go to Moosa, for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, spoke directly to him (cf. 4:164). But Moosa will say: I am not the one you want; go to 'Eesa Ibn Maryam, for he healed those born blind and the lepers, and he brought forth the dead. But 'Eesa will say: I am not the one you want; go to the leader of the sons of Adam, for he is the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection. Go to Muhammad, for he will intercede for you with your Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. Then (the Prophet) will go and Jibreel will come to his Lord and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Give him permission and give him the glad tidings of Paradise. Jibreel will take him and he will fall down in prostration for a week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intercession will be accepted. So he will raise his head, and when he looks at his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, he will fall down in prostration for another week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intersession will be accepted. He will start to fall down in prostration again, but Jibreel (peace be upon him) will take hold of his upper arms and Allah, may he be glorified and exalted, will inspire him to offer a supplication such as no human being was ever inspired with. He will say: `O Lord, You created me as the leader of the sons of Adam, and no boast; the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection, and no boast; there will come to my Cistern more people than there can be between San‘a’ and Allah (Eilat).` Then it will be said: Call the Siddeeq's so that they might intercede. Then it will be said: Call the Prophets. So one Prophet will come with a group, and another Prophet will come with five or six people, and another Prophet will come with nobody. Then it will be said: Call the martyrs so that they might intercede for whoever they want. When the martyrs do that, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: I am the Most Merciful of those who show mercy; I admit to My Paradise anyone who does not associate anything with Me.\n\nSo they will enter Paradise. Then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look in Hell; can you find anyone who ever did anything good? And they will find a man in Hell, and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that I was easy-going with people in buying and selling.

For less than twenty-five camels, for each five, one sheep (should be given). If the number reaches twenty-five, then one she-camel in its second year (should be given), up to thirty-five. If there is no she-camel in its second year, then a he-camel in its third year (may be given). If the number reaches thirty-six, then a she-camel in its third year (should be given), up to forty-five. If the number reaches forty-six, then a she-camel in its fourth year that has been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to sixty, If the number reaches sixty-one, then a she-camel in its fifth year (should be given), up to seventy five. If the number reaches seventy-six, then two she-camels in their second year (should be given), up to ninety. If the number reaches ninety-one, then two she camels in their fourth year that have been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to one hundred and twenty. If the number is more than one hundred and twenty, then for every forty camels, a she-camel limits third year should be given and for every fifty a she-camel in its fourth year. If the ages of the camels for zakah differ, if what is due is a she-camel in its fifth year but he does not own such a camel, but he has a she-camel in its fourth year, then that will be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, if available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she-camel in its fourth year and he only has a she camel in its fifth year, it should be accepted from him and the zakat collector should give him back twenty dirhams or two sheep. If what is due from him is a shecamel in its fourth year, but he does not have such a cameland he has a she-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, is available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she camel in its second year, but he only has a he-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and nothing should be added to it. If he has only four camels, no zakah is due unless the owner wants to give it. With regard to zakah on sheep in the pasture, if there are forty sheep, then one sheep is due as zakah, up to one hundred and twenty sheep. of there is one more than that, then two sheep are due, up to two hundred. If there is one more than that then three sheep are due, up to three hundred. If there is one more than that, then for every hundred sheep, one sheep is due No toothless or defective sheep should be taken as zakah and neither should a ram, unless the one who is giving allows that. Separate flocks should not be put together and flocks should not be divided so as to avoid or reduce zakah. If there are two partners [and the zakah-collector comes and takes zakah), they should settle the matter between them on a fair basis. If a man's flock is grazing if it is one less than forty, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it. On silver the zakah is one quarter of one tenth; if the wealth is only one hundred and ninety dirhams, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it.",

Then he said: Abu Bakr told me and he swore by Allah that he was telling the truth, that he heard the Prophet (ﷺ) say: `The Prophet is not to be inherited from; rather his estate is to go to the poor and needy Muslims.` And Abu Bakr told me and swore by Allah that he was telling the truth, that the Prophet (ﷺ) Said: 'No Prophet dies until he has been led in prayer by one of his ummah.` This is what was in the possession of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and we saw how he dealt with it.

He said: No, not until you tell us what happened when the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) went out and you were with him. Abu Bakr said: We started our journey at the beginning of the night and we hastened for one day and one night, until it was midday. I looked into the distance to see whether there was anywhere to seek shade, and I saw a rock, so I went to it and it had a little shade. I smoothed the ground for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and spread a garment of camel hair for him, and said: Lie down and rest, O Messenger of Allah. So he lay down, and I went out to see if I could spot anyone looking for us. Then I saw a shepherd and I said: Who do you belong to, O boy? He said: To a man of Quraish. He mentioned his name and I recognised it. I said: Is there any milk in your sheep? He said: Yes | said: Will you milk some for me? He said: Yes. I told him to do that, so he caught a sheep, then I told him to brush the dust from its teat, then to brush the dust off his hands. I had a small vessel with me on the neck of which was a cloth. He milked a little bit of milk for me and I poured it into the vessel until it cooled down. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When I reached him, he had already woken up. I said: Drink, O Messenger of Allah. He drank until I was pleased, then I said: Is it time to move on? So we moved on and the people were coming after us but none of them caught up with us except Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju'shum, who was riding a horse of his, I said: O Messenger of Allah, someone has caught up with us. He said: `Do not be afraid, for Allah is with us.` When he got close to us, and there was no more between us and him then the length of a spear or two or three spears, I said: O Messenger of Allah, this pursuer has caught up with us, and I wept. He said: `Why are you weeping?` I said: I am not weeping for myself; rather I am weeping for you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed against him [the pursuer] and said: “O Allah, protect us from him by whatever means You will.” Then his horse's legs sank into the solid ground up to its belly, and he fell off it. He said: O Muhammad, I know that this is because of you; pray to Allah to save me from my predicament, and by Allah I shall divert away from you any one who is behind me of those who are seeking you. Here is my quiver, take one arrow. You are going to pass by some camels and sheep of mine in such and such a place, take whatever you need from thern. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `I have no need of it.“ The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed for him and he was released, and he went back to his companions. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and I continued on our way until we came to Madinah, where the people met him. They came out on the road and on the roofs, and a lot of servants and children crowded the road saying: Allahu Akbar, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) has come, Muhammad has come. The people disputed as to who he would stay with. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Tonight I will stay with Banun-Najjar, the maternal uncles of 'Abdul-Muttalib, to honour them thereby.” The next morning, he went where he was instructed. Al-Bara' bin 'Azib said: The first of the Muhajireen to come to us was Mus'ab bin 'Umair, the brother of Banu 'Abdud-Dar. Then Ibn Umm Maktoom, the blind man and brother of Banu Fihr, came to us. Then 'Umar bin al-Khattab, came to us with twenty riders and we said: What happened to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? He said: He is behind me. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came and Abu Bakr was with him. Al-Bara said: the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not come until I had read some soorahs from al-Mufassal [Al-Mufassal is that portion of the Qur'an which goes from Qaf to an-Nas].

The people said to Abu Bakr: Why don't you ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) what is the matter? He did something today that he never did before. So he asked him and he said: `Yes, I was shown what is to come of this world and the Hereafter. The earlier and later generations were gathered in one place and the people got terrified because of that. They went to Adam when the sweat was about to reach their mouths, and they said: O Adam, you are the father of mankind and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose you. Intercede for us with your Lord, He said: I am in the same position as you. Go to your father after your father, to Nooh, “Allah chose Adam, Nooh (Noah), the family of Ibraheem (Abraham) and the family of 'Imran above the 'Alameen (mankind and jinn) (of their times)` (Al 'Imran 3:33}.\n\nThen they will go to Nooh and will say: Intercede with your Lord for us, for Allah chose you and answered your supplication, and He did not leave one of the disbelievers on the Earth (cf. 71:26). He will say: I am not the one you want; go to Ibraheem for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, took him as a close friend (khaleel). So they will go to Ibraheem but he will say: I am not the one you want; go to Moosa, for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, spoke directly to him (cf. 4:164). But Moosa will say: I am not the one you want; go to 'Eesa Ibn Maryam, for he healed those born blind and the lepers, and he brought forth the dead. But 'Eesa will say: I am not the one you want; go to the leader of the sons of Adam, for he is the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection. Go to Muhammad, for he will intercede for you with your Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. Then (the Prophet) will go and Jibreel will come to his Lord and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Give him permission and give him the glad tidings of Paradise. Jibreel will take him and he will fall down in prostration for a week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intercession will be accepted. So he will raise his head, and when he looks at his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, he will fall down in prostration for another week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intersession will be accepted. He will start to fall down in prostration again, but Jibreel (peace be upon him) will take hold of his upper arms and Allah, may he be glorified and exalted, will inspire him to offer a supplication such as no human being was ever inspired with. He will say: `O Lord, You created me as the leader of the sons of Adam, and no boast; the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection, and no boast; there will come to my Cistern more people than there can be between San‘a’ and Allah (Eilat).` Then it will be said: Call the Siddeeq's so that they might intercede. Then it will be said: Call the Prophets. So one Prophet will come with a group, and another Prophet will come with five or six people, and another Prophet will come with nobody. Then it will be said: Call the martyrs so that they might intercede for whoever they want. When the martyrs do that, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: I am the Most Merciful of those who show mercy; I admit to My Paradise anyone who does not associate anything with Me.\n\nSo they will enter Paradise. Then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look in Hell; can you find anyone who ever did anything good? And they will find a man in Hell, and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that I was easy-going with people in buying and selling. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Be easy-going with My slave as he was easygoing with My slaves. Then they will bring a man out of Hell and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that l instructed my sons: When I die, burn me with fire, then grind me until I am like kohl powder. Then take me to the sea and scatter me in the wind, for by Allah the Lord of the Worlds will never be able to punish me. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Why did you do that? He will say: For fear of You. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look at the kingdom of the greatest king and you will have the like thereof and ten times as much. He will say: Are You making fun of me when You are the Sovereign? He (the Prophet (ﷺ) said: “That is what I was smiling at, at the time of the foremoon.`",

Then Abu Bakr said: Your brother ‘Umar came to me and told me that he passed by you and greeted you but you did not return his greeting; what made you do that? I said: I did not do that. 'Umar said: Yes, by Allah, you did that, but you have too much pride, O Banu Umayyah. I said: By Allah, I did not realise that you had passed me or greeted me. Abu Bakr said: 'Uthman is telling the truth; is something bothering you? I said: Yes. He said: What is it? 'Uthman said: Allah, may He be glorifică and exalted, has caused His Prophet (ﷺ) to die before we could ask him how we can save ourselves, Abu Bakr said: I asked him about that. ('Uthman] said: I went to him and said: May my father and mother be sacrificed for you, you were more deserving to ask it. Abu Bakr said: I said:O Messenger of Allah, what is salvation? The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: “Whoever accepts this word from me that I asked my uncle to say but he rejected it, it is salvation for him.`",

Whoever among the Muslims is asked to pay it in the proper manner, let him give it; whoever is asked for more than that, let him not give it. For less than twenty-five camels, for each five, one sheep (should be given). If the number reaches twenty-five, then one she-camel in its second year (should be given), up to thirty-five. If there is no she-camel in its second year, then a he-camel in its third year (may be given). If the number reaches thirty-six, then a she-camel in its third year (should be given), up to forty-five. If the number reaches forty-six, then a she-camel in its fourth year that has been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to sixty, If the number reaches sixty-one, then a she-camel in its fifth year (should be given), up to seventy five. If the number reaches seventy-six, then two she-camels in their second year (should be given), up to ninety. If the number reaches ninety-one, then two she camels in their fourth year that have been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to one hundred and twenty. If the number is more than one hundred and twenty, then for every forty camels, a she-camel limits third year should be given and for every fifty a she-camel in its fourth year. If the ages of the camels for zakah differ, if what is due is a she-camel in its fifth year but he does not own such a camel, but he has a she-camel in its fourth year, then that will be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, if available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she-camel in its fourth year and he only has a she camel in its fifth year, it should be accepted from him and the zakat collector should give him back twenty dirhams or two sheep. If what is due from him is a shecamel in its fourth year, but he does not have such a cameland he has a she-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, is available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she camel in its second year, but he only has a he-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and nothing should be added to it. If he has only four camels, no zakah is due unless the owner wants to give it. With regard to zakah on sheep in the pasture, if there are forty sheep, then one sheep is due as zakah, up to one hundred and twenty sheep. of there is one more than that, then two sheep are due, up to two hundred. If there is one more than that then three sheep are due, up to three hundred. If there is one more than that, then for every hundred sheep, one sheep is due No toothless or defective sheep should be taken as zakah and neither should a ram, unless the one who is giving allows that. Separate flocks should not be put together and flocks should not be divided so as to avoid or reduce zakah. If there are two partners [and the zakah-collector comes and takes zakah), they should settle the matter between them on a fair basis. If a man's flock is grazing if it is one less than forty, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it. On silver the zakah is one quarter of one tenth; if the wealth is only one hundred and ninety dirhams, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it.",

Abu Bakr said: We started our journey at the beginning of the night and we hastened for one day and one night, until it was midday. I looked into the distance to see whether there was anywhere to seek shade, and I saw a rock, so I went to it and it had a little shade. I smoothed the ground for the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and spread a garment of camel hair for him, and said: Lie down and rest, O Messenger of Allah. So he lay down, and I went out to see if I could spot anyone looking for us. Then I saw a shepherd and I said: Who do you belong to, O boy? He said: To a man of Quraish. He mentioned his name and I recognised it. I said: Is there any milk in your sheep? He said: Yes | said: Will you milk some for me? He said: Yes. I told him to do that, so he caught a sheep, then I told him to brush the dust from its teat, then to brush the dust off his hands. I had a small vessel with me on the neck of which was a cloth. He milked a little bit of milk for me and I poured it into the vessel until it cooled down. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ). When I reached him, he had already woken up. I said: Drink, O Messenger of Allah. He drank until I was pleased, then I said: Is it time to move on? So we moved on and the people were coming after us but none of them caught up with us except Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju'shum, who was riding a horse of his, I said: O Messenger of Allah, someone has caught up with us. He said: `Do not be afraid, for Allah is with us.` When he got close to us, and there was no more between us and him then the length of a spear or two or three spears, I said: O Messenger of Allah, this pursuer has caught up with us, and I wept. He said: `Why are you weeping?` I said: I am not weeping for myself; rather I am weeping for you. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) prayed against him [the pursuer] and said: “O Allah, protect us from him by whatever means You will.” Then his horse's legs sank into the solid ground up to its belly, and he fell off it. He said: O Muhammad, I know that this is because of you; pray to Allah to save me from my predicament, and by Allah I shall divert away from you any one who is behind me of those who are seeking you. Here is my quiver, take one arrow. You are going to pass by some camels and sheep of mine in such and such a place, take whatever you need from thern.

The people disputed as to who he would stay with. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: `Tonight I will stay with Banun-Najjar, the maternal uncles of 'Abdul-Muttalib, to honour them thereby.” The next morning, he went where he was instructed. Al-Bara' bin 'Azib said: The first of the Muhajireen to come to us was Mus'ab bin 'Umair, the brother of Banu 'Abdud-Dar. Then Ibn Umm Maktoom, the blind man and brother of Banu Fihr, came to us. Then 'Umar bin al-Khattab, came to us with twenty riders and we said: What happened to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)? He said: He is behind me. Then the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) came and Abu Bakr was with him. Al-Bara said: the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not come until I had read some soorahs from al-Mufassal [Al-Mufassal is that portion of the Qur'an which goes from Qaf to an-Nas]. Isra'eel said: al-Bara' was one of the Ansar from Banu Harithah.",

Then he sat where he was until he had prayed Zuhr, 'Asr and Maghrib, and he did not speak until he had prayed 'isha'. Then he got up and went to his family. The people said to Abu Bakr: Why don't you ask the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) what is the matter? He did something today that he never did before. So he asked him and he said: `Yes, I was shown what is to come of this world and the Hereafter. The earlier and later generations were gathered in one place and the people got terrified because of that. They went to Adam when the sweat was about to reach their mouths, and they said: O Adam, you are the father of mankind and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, chose you. Intercede for us with your Lord, He said: I am in the same position as you. Go to your father after your father, to Nooh, “Allah chose Adam, Nooh (Noah), the family of Ibraheem (Abraham) and the family of 'Imran above the 'Alameen (mankind and jinn) (of their times)` (Al 'Imran 3:33}.\n\nThen they will go to Nooh and will say: Intercede with your Lord for us, for Allah chose you and answered your supplication, and He did not leave one of the disbelievers on the Earth (cf. 71:26). He will say: I am not the one you want; go to Ibraheem for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, took him as a close friend (khaleel). So they will go to Ibraheem but he will say: I am not the one you want; go to Moosa, for Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, spoke directly to him (cf. 4:164). But Moosa will say: I am not the one you want; go to 'Eesa Ibn Maryam, for he healed those born blind and the lepers, and he brought forth the dead. But 'Eesa will say: I am not the one you want; go to the leader of the sons of Adam, for he is the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection. Go to Muhammad, for he will intercede for you with your Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. Then (the Prophet) will go and Jibreel will come to his Lord and Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Give him permission and give him the glad tidings of Paradise. Jibreel will take him and he will fall down in prostration for a week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intercession will be accepted. So he will raise his head, and when he looks at his Lord, may He be glorified and exalted, he will fall down in prostration for another week. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Raise your head, O Muhammad; speak and you will be heard, intercede and your intersession will be accepted. He will start to fall down in prostration again, but Jibreel (peace be upon him) will take hold of his upper arms and Allah, may he be glorified and exalted, will inspire him to offer a supplication such as no human being was ever inspired with. He will say: `O Lord, You created me as the leader of the sons of Adam, and no boast; the first one for whom the earth is split on the Day of Resurrection, and no boast; there will come to my Cistern more people than there can be between San‘a’ and Allah (Eilat).` Then it will be said: Call the Siddeeq's so that they might intercede. Then it will be said: Call the Prophets. So one Prophet will come with a group, and another Prophet will come with five or six people, and another Prophet will come with nobody. Then it will be said: Call the martyrs so that they might intercede for whoever they want. When the martyrs do that, Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: I am the Most Merciful of those who show mercy; I admit to My Paradise anyone who does not associate anything with Me.\n\nSo they will enter Paradise. Then Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look in Hell; can you find anyone who ever did anything good? And they will find a man in Hell, and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that I was easy-going with people in buying and selling. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Be easy-going with My slave as he was easygoing with My slaves. Then they will bring a man out of Hell and He will say to him: Did you ever do anything good? He will say: No, except that l instructed my sons: When I die, burn me with fire, then grind me until I am like kohl powder. Then take me to the sea and scatter me in the wind, for by Allah the Lord of the Worlds will never be able to punish me. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Why did you do that? He will say: For fear of You. And Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, will say: Look at the kingdom of the greatest king and you will have the like thereof and ten times as much. He will say: Are You making fun of me when You are the Sovereign? He (the Prophet (ﷺ) said: “That is what I was smiling at, at the time of the foremoon.`",

For less than twenty-five camels, for each five, one sheep (should be given). If the number reaches twenty-five, then one she-camel in its second year (should be given), up to thirty-five. If there is no she-camel in its second year, then a he-camel in its third year (may be given). If the number reaches thirty-six, then a she-camel in its third year (should be given), up to forty-five. If the number reaches forty-six, then a she-camel in its fourth year that has been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to sixty, If the number reaches sixty-one, then a she-camel in its fifth year (should be given), up to seventy five. If the number reaches seventy-six, then two she-camels in their second year (should be given), up to ninety. If the number reaches ninety-one, then two she camels in their fourth year that have been bred to a stallion camel should be given, up to one hundred and twenty. If the number is more than one hundred and twenty, then for every forty camels, a she-camel limits third year should be given and for every fifty a she-camel in its fourth year. If the ages of the camels for zakah differ, if what is due is a she-camel in its fifth year but he does not own such a camel, but he has a she-camel in its fourth year, then that will be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, if available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she-camel in its fourth year and he only has a she camel in its fifth year, it should be accepted from him and the zakat collector should give him back twenty dirhams or two sheep. If what is due from him is a shecamel in its fourth year, but he does not have such a cameland he has a she-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and he should add to it two sheep, is available, or twenty dirhams. If what is due from him is a she camel in its second year, but he only has a he-camel in its third year, then it should be accepted from him and nothing should be added to it. If he has only four camels, no zakah is due unless the owner wants to give it. With regard to zakah on sheep in the pasture, if there are forty sheep, then one sheep is due as zakah, up to one hundred and twenty sheep. of there is one more than that, then two sheep are due, up to two hundred. If there is one more than that then three sheep are due, up to three hundred. If there is one more than that, then for every hundred sheep, one sheep is due No toothless or defective sheep should be taken as zakah and neither should a ram, unless the one who is giving allows that. Separate flocks should not be put together and flocks should not be divided so as to avoid or reduce zakah. If there are two partners [and the zakah-collector comes and takes zakah), they should settle the matter between them on a fair basis. If a man's flock is grazing if it is one less than forty, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it. On silver the zakah is one quarter of one tenth; if the wealth is only one hundred and ninety dirhams, then no zakah is due on it unless the owner wants to give it.",
