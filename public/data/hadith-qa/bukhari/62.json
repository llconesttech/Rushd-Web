His being a witness will compensate him for not sharing the right of ruling. If Sa`d becomes the \nruler, it will be alright: otherwise, whoever becomes the ruler should seek his help, as I have not \ndismissed him because of disability or dishonesty.\" `Umar added, \"I recommend that my successor \ntakes care of the early emigrants; to know their rights and protect their honor and sacred things. \nI also recommend that he be kind to the Ansar who had lived in Medina before the emigrants and \nBelief had entered their hearts before them.

I also recommend him concerning Allah's and \nHis Apostle's protectees (i.e. Dhimmis) to fulfill their contracts and to fight for them and not to \noverburden them with what is beyond their ability.\" So when `Umar expired, we carried him out and \nset out walking. `Abdullah bin `Umar greeted (`Aisha) and said, \"`Umar bin Al-Khattab asks for the \npermission.\" `Aisha said, \"Bring him in.\" He was brought in and buried beside his two companions. \nWhen he was buried, the group (recommended by `Umar) held a meeting. Then `Abdur-Rahman said, \n\" Reduce the candidates for rulership to three of you.\" Az-Zubair said, \"I give up my right to `Ali.\" \nTalha said, \"I give up my right to `Uthman,\" Sa`d, 'I give up my right to `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf.\" \n`Abdur-Rahman then said (to `Uthman and `Ali), \"Now which of you is willing to give up his right of \ncandidacy to that he may choose the better of the (remaining) two, bearing in mind that Allah and \nIslam will be his witnesses.\" So both the sheiks (i.e. `Uthman and `Ali) kept silent. `Abdur-Rahman \nsaid, \"Will you both leave this matter to me, and I take Allah as my Witness that I will not choose but \nthe better of you?\" They said, \"Yes.\" So `Abdur-Rahman took the hand of one of them (i.e. `Ali) and \nsaid, \"You are related to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and one of the earliest Muslims as you know well.

The day he was stabbed, I was \nstanding and there was nobody between me and him (i.e. `Umar) except `Abdullah bin `Abbas. \nWhenever `Umar passed between the two rows, he would say, \"Stand in straight lines.\" \nWhen he saw no defect (in the rows), he would go forward and start the prayer with Takbir. He would \nrecite Surat Yusuf or An-Nahl or the like in the first rak`a so that the people may have the time to Join \nthe prayer. As soon as he said Takbir, I heard him saying, \"The dog has killed or eaten me,\" at the \ntime he (i.e. the murderer) stabbed him. A non-Arab infidel proceeded on carrying a double-edged \nknife and stabbing all the persons he passed by on the right and left (till) he stabbed thirteen persons \nout of whom seven died. When one of the Muslims saw that, he threw a cloak on him. Realizing that \nhe had been captured, the non-Arab infidel killed himself, `Umar held the hand of `Abdur-Rahman bin \n`Auf and let him lead the prayer. \nThose who were standing by the side of `Umar saw what I saw, but the people who were in the other \nparts of the Mosque did not see anything, but they lost the voice of `Umar and they were saying, \n\"Subhan Allah!

Find out who attacked me.\" \nIbn `Abbas kept on looking here and there for a short time and came to say. \"The slave of Al \nMughira.\" On that `Umar said, \"The craftsman?\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"Yes.\" `Umar said, \"May Allah \ncurse him.

Some said, \"Do not worry (he will be Alright soon).\" Some said, \n\"We are afraid (that he will die).\" Then an infusion of dates was brought to him and he drank it but it \ncame out (of the wound) of his belly. Then milk was brought to him and he drank it, and it also came \nout of his belly. The people realized that he would die. We went to him, and the people came, praising \nhim.

It is as you wish. She has given the permission.\" `Umar said, \n\"Praise be to Allah, there was nothing more important to me than this. So when I die, take me, and \ngreet `Aisha and say: \"`Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission (to be buried with the Prophet (ﷺ) ), and \nif she gives the permission, bury me there, and if she refuses, then take me to the grave-yard of the \nMuslims.\" \nThen Hafsa (the mother of the believers) came with many other women walking with her. When we \nsaw her, we went away. She went in (to `Umar) and wept there for sometime. When the men asked for \npermission to enter, she went into another place, and we heard her weeping inside. The people said (to \n`Umar), \"O chief of the believers! Appoint a successor.\" `Umar said, \"I do not find anyone more \nsuitable for the job than the following persons or group whom Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had been pleased with \nbefore he died.\" Then `Umar mentioned `Ali, `Uthman, AzZubair, Talha, Sa`d and `Abdur-Rahman \n(bin `Auf) and said, \"Abdullah bin `Umar will be a witness to you, but he will have no share in the \nrule. His being a witness will compensate him for not sharing the right of ruling. If Sa`d becomes the \nruler, it will be alright: otherwise, whoever becomes the ruler should seek his help, as I have not \ndismissed him because of disability or dishonesty.\" `Umar added, \"I recommend that my successor \ntakes care of the early emigrants; to know their rights and protect their honor and sacred things. \nI also recommend that he be kind to the Ansar who had lived in Medina before the emigrants and \nBelief had entered their hearts before them. I recommend that the (ruler) should accept the good of the \nrighteous among them and excuse their wrong-doers, and I recommend that he should do good to all \nthe people of the towns (Al-Ansar), as they are the protectors of Islam and the source of wealth and \nthe source of annoyance to the enemy. I also recommend that nothing be taken from them except from \ntheir surplus with their consent. I also recommend that he do good to the 'Arab bedouin, as they are \nthe origin of the 'Arabs and the material of Islam. He should take from what is inferior, amongst their \nproperties and distribute that to the poor amongst them. I also recommend him concerning Allah's and \nHis Apostle's protectees (i.e. Dhimmis) to fulfill their contracts and to fight for them and not to \noverburden them with what is beyond their ability.\" So when `Umar expired, we carried him out and \nset out walking. `Abdullah bin `Umar greeted (`Aisha) and said, \"`Umar bin Al-Khattab asks for the \npermission.\" `Aisha said, \"Bring him in.\" He was brought in and buried beside his two companions. \nWhen he was buried, the group (recommended by `Umar) held a meeting. Then `Abdur-Rahman said, \n\" Reduce the candidates for rulership to three of you.\" Az-Zubair said, \"I give up my right to `Ali.\" \nTalha said, \"I give up my right to `Uthman,\" Sa`d, 'I give up my right to `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf.\" \n`Abdur-Rahman then said (to `Uthman and `Ali), \"Now which of you is willing to give up his right of \ncandidacy to that he may choose the better of the (remaining) two, bearing in mind that Allah and \nIslam will be his witnesses.\" So both the sheiks (i.e. `Uthman and `Ali) kept silent. `Abdur-Rahman \nsaid, \"Will you both leave this matter to me, and I take Allah as my Witness that I will not choose but \nthe better of you?\" They said, \"Yes.\" So `Abdur-Rahman took the hand of one of them (i.e. `Ali) and \nsaid, \"You are related to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and one of the earliest Muslims as you know well.

The day he was stabbed, I was \nstanding and there was nobody between me and him (i.e. `Umar) except `Abdullah bin `Abbas. \nWhenever `Umar passed between the two rows, he would say, \"Stand in straight lines.\" \nWhen he saw no defect (in the rows), he would go forward and start the prayer with Takbir.

As soon as he said Takbir, I heard him saying, \"The dog has killed or eaten me,\" at the \ntime he (i.e. the murderer) stabbed him. A non-Arab infidel proceeded on carrying a double-edged \nknife and stabbing all the persons he passed by on the right and left (till) he stabbed thirteen persons \nout of whom seven died. When one of the Muslims saw that, he threw a cloak on him. Realizing that \nhe had been captured, the non-Arab infidel killed himself, `Umar held the hand of `Abdur-Rahman bin \n`Auf and let him lead the prayer. \nThose who were standing by the side of `Umar saw what I saw, but the people who were in the other \nparts of the Mosque did not see anything, but they lost the voice of `Umar and they were saying, \n\"Subhan Allah!

Find out who attacked me.\" \nIbn `Abbas kept on looking here and there for a short time and came to say. \"The slave of Al \nMughira.\" On that `Umar said, \"The craftsman?\" Ibn `Abbas said, \"Yes.\" `Umar said, \"May Allah \ncurse him.

Some said, \"Do not worry (he will be Alright soon).\" Some said, \n\"We are afraid (that he will die).\" Then an infusion of dates was brought to him and he drank it but it \ncame out (of the wound) of his belly. Then milk was brought to him and he drank it, and it also came \nout of his belly. The people realized that he would die. We went to him, and the people came, praising \nhim.

It is as you wish. She has given the permission.\" `Umar said, \n\"Praise be to Allah, there was nothing more important to me than this. So when I die, take me, and \ngreet `Aisha and say: \"`Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission (to be buried with the Prophet (ﷺ) ), and \nif she gives the permission, bury me there, and if she refuses, then take me to the grave-yard of the \nMuslims.\" \nThen Hafsa (the mother of the believers) came with many other women walking with her. When we \nsaw her, we went away. She went in (to `Umar) and wept there for sometime. When the men asked for \npermission to enter, she went into another place, and we heard her weeping inside. The people said (to \n`Umar), \"O chief of the believers!

His being a witness will compensate him for not sharing the right of ruling. If Sa`d becomes the \nruler, it will be alright: otherwise, whoever becomes the ruler should seek his help, as I have not \ndismissed him because of disability or dishonesty.\" `Umar added, \"I recommend that my successor \ntakes care of the early emigrants; to know their rights and protect their honor and sacred things. \nI also recommend that he be kind to the Ansar who had lived in Medina before the emigrants and \nBelief had entered their hearts before them. I recommend that the (ruler) should accept the good of the \nrighteous among them and excuse their wrong-doers, and I recommend that he should do good to all \nthe people of the towns (Al-Ansar), as they are the protectors of Islam and the source of wealth and \nthe source of annoyance to the enemy. I also recommend that nothing be taken from them except from \ntheir surplus with their consent. I also recommend that he do good to the 'Arab bedouin, as they are \nthe origin of the 'Arabs and the material of Islam. He should take from what is inferior, amongst their \nproperties and distribute that to the poor amongst them. I also recommend him concerning Allah's and \nHis Apostle's protectees (i.e. Dhimmis) to fulfill their contracts and to fight for them and not to \noverburden them with what is beyond their ability.\" So when `Umar expired, we carried him out and \nset out walking. `Abdullah bin `Umar greeted (`Aisha) and said, \"`Umar bin Al-Khattab asks for the \npermission.\" `Aisha said, \"Bring him in.\" He was brought in and buried beside his two companions. \nWhen he was buried, the group (recommended by `Umar) held a meeting. Then `Abdur-Rahman said, \n\" Reduce the candidates for rulership to three of you.\" Az-Zubair said, \"I give up my right to `Ali.\" \nTalha said, \"I give up my right to `Uthman,\" Sa`d, 'I give up my right to `Abdur-Rahman bin `Auf.\" \n`Abdur-Rahman then said (to `Uthman and `Ali), \"Now which of you is willing to give up his right of \ncandidacy to that he may choose the better of the (remaining) two, bearing in mind that Allah and \nIslam will be his witnesses.\" So both the sheiks (i.e. `Uthman and `Ali) kept silent. `Abdur-Rahman \nsaid, \"Will you both leave this matter to me, and I take Allah as my Witness that I will not choose but \nthe better of you?\" They said, \"Yes.\" So `Abdur-Rahman took the hand of one of them (i.e. `Ali) and \nsaid, \"You are related to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and one of the earliest Muslims as you know well.
