They were admitted and took \ntheir seats in the house. \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"O Aba-Hirr!\" I said, \"Labbaik, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" He said, \"Take it and give it to \nthem.\" So I took the bowl (of milk) and started giving it to one man who would drink his fill and \nreturn it to me, whereupon I would give it to another man who, in his turn, would drink his fill and \nreturn it to me, and I would then offer it to another man who would drink his fill and return it to me. \nFinally, after the whole group had drunk their fill, I reached the Prophet (ﷺ) who took the bowl and put it \non his hand, looked at me and smiled and said. \"O Aba Hirr!\" I replied, \"Labbaik, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" \nHe said, \"There remain you and I.\" I said, \"You have said the truth, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" He said, \"Sit \ndown and drink.\" I sat down and drank.

He kept on telling me \nrepeatedly to drink, till I said, \"No. by Allah Who sent you with the Truth, I have no space for it (in \nmy stomach).\" He said, \"Hand it over to me.\" When I gave him the bowl, he praised Allah and \npronounced Allah's Name on it and drank the remaining milk.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 6452, Book 81, Hadith 41","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What does this narration teach about the generosity and selflessness of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ)?","id":"bukhari-81-41"},{"hadith-eng":"I was the first man among the Arabs to throw an arrow for Allah's Cause.

These hooks will snatch \nthe people according to their deeds. Some people will be ruined because of their evil deeds, and some \nwill be cut into pieces and fall down in Hell, but will be saved afterwards, when Allah has finished the \njudgments among His slaves, and intends to take out of the Fire whoever He wishes to take out from \namong those who used to testify that none had the right to be worshipped but Allah. \nWe will order the angels to take them out and the angels will know them by the mark of the traces of \nprostration (on their foreheads) for Allah banned the f ire to consume the traces of prostration on the \nbody of Adam's son. So they will take them out, and by then they would have burnt (as coal), and then \nwater, called Ma'ul Hayat (water of life) will be poured on them, and they will spring out like a seed \nsprings out on the bank of a rainwater stream, and there will remain one man who will be facing the \n(Hell) Fire and will say, 'O Lord! It's (Hell's) vapor has Poisoned and smoked me and its flame has \nburnt me; please turn my face away from the Fire.' He will keep on invoking Allah till Allah says, \n'Perhaps, if I give you what you want), you will ask for another thing?' The man will say, 'No, by Your \nPower, I will not ask You for anything else.' \nThen Allah will turn his face away from the Fire. The man will say after that, 'O Lord, bring me near \nthe gate of Paradise.' Allah will say (to him), 'Didn't you promise not to ask for anything else? Woe to \nyou, O son of Adam ! How treacherous you are!' The man will keep on invoking Allah till Allah will \nsay, 'But if I give you that, you may ask me for something else.' The man will say, 'No, by Your \nPower. I will not ask for anything else.' He will give Allah his covenant and promise not to ask for \nanything else after that. So Allah will bring him near to the gate of Paradise, and when he sees what is \nin it, he will remain silent as long as Allah will, and then he will say, 'O Lord! Let me enter Paradise.' \nAllah will say, 'Didn't you promise that you would not ask Me for anything other than that? Woe to \nyou, O son of Adam ! How treacherous you are!' On that, the man will say, 'O Lord! Do not make me \nthe most wretched of Your creation,' and will keep on invoking Allah till Allah will smile and when \nAllah will smile because of him, then He will allow him to enter Paradise, and when he will enter \nParadise, he will be addressed, 'Wish from so-and-so.' He will wish till all his wishes will be fulfilled, \nthen Allah will say, All this (i.e. what you have wished for) and as much again therewith are for you.' \n\" \nAbu Huraira added: That man will be the last of the people of Paradise to enter (Paradise).","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 6573, Book 81, Hadith 161","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"How will people recognize their Lord on the Day of Resurrection according to Islamic teachings?","id":"bukhari-81-162"},{"hadith-eng":"Abu Sa`id was sitting in the company of Abu \nHuraira and he did not deny anything of his narration till he reached his saying: \"All this and as much \nagain therewith are for you.\" Then Abu Sa`id said, \"I heard Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) saying, 'This is for you \nand ten times as much.' \" Abu Huraira said, \"In my memory it is 'as much again therewith.' \"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 6574, Book 81, Hadith 162","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"How does the concept of reward multiplication manifest in Islamic teachings?","id":"bukhari-81-163"},{"hadith-eng":"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"I am your predecessor at the Lake-Fount.\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 6575, Book 81, Hadith 163","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What is the significance of the Lake-Fount in Islamic eschatology?","id":"bukhari-81-164"},{"hadith-eng":"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"I \nam your predecessor at the Lake-Fount, and some of you will be brought in front of me till I will see \nthem and then they will be taken away from me and I will say, 'O Lord, my companions!'
