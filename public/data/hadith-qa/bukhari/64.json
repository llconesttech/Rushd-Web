When they reached (a place called) Al-Hadah between 'Usfan and \nMecca, their presence was made known to a sub-tribe of Hudhail called Banu Lihyan. So they sent \nabout one hundred archers after them. The archers traced the footsteps (of the Muslims) till they found \nthe traces of dates which they had eaten at one of their camping places. The archers said, \"These dates \nare of Yathrib (i.e. Medina),\" and went on tracing the Muslims' footsteps. When `Asim and his \ncompanions became aware of them, they took refuge in a (high) place. But the enemy encircled them \nand said, \"Come down and surrender. We give you a solemn promise and covenant that we will not \nkill anyone of you.\" `Asim bin Thabit said, \"O people! As for myself, I will never get down to be \nunder the protection of an infidel. O Allah! Inform your Prophet about us.\" So the archers threw their \narrows at them and martyred `Asim. Three of them came down and surrendered to them, accepting \ntheir promise and covenant and they were Khubaib, Zaid bin Ad-Dathina and another man. When the \narchers got hold of them, they untied the strings of the arrow bows and tied their captives with them. \nThe third man said, \"This is the first proof of treachery! By Allah, I will not go with you for I follow \nthe example of these.\" He meant the martyred companions. The archers dragged him and struggled \nwith him (till they martyred him). Then Khubaib and Zaid bin Ad-Dathina were taken away by them \nand later on they sold them as slaves in Mecca after the event of the Badr battle. \nThe sons of Al-Harit bin `Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib for he was a person who had killed (their \nfather) Al-Hari bin `Amr on the day (of the battle) of Badr. Khubaib remained imprisoned by them till \nthey decided unanimously to kill him. One day Khubaib borrowed from a daughter of Al-Harith, a \nrazor for shaving his pubic hair, and she lent it to him. By chance, while she was inattentive, a little \nson of hers went to him (i.e. Khubaib) and she saw that Khubaib had seated him on his thigh while the \nrazor was in his hand. She was so much terrified that Khubaib noticed her fear and said, \"Are you \nafraid that I will kill him? Never would I do such a thing.\" Later on (while narrating the story) she \nsaid, \"By Allah, I had never seen a better captive than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating \nfrom a bunch of grapes in his hand while he was fettered with iron chains and (at that time) there was \nno fruit in Mecca.\" She used to say,\" It was food Allah had provided Khubaib with.\" \nWhen they took him to Al-Hil out of Mecca sanctuary to martyr him, Khubaib requested them. \n\"Allow me to offer a two-rak`at prayer.\" They allowed him and he prayed two rak`at and then said, \n\"By Allah! Had I not been afraid that you would think I was worried, I would have prayed more.\" \nThen he (invoked evil upon them) saying, \"O Allah! Count them and kill them one by one, and do not \nleave anyone of them\"' Then he recited: \"As I am martyred as a Muslim, I do not care in what way I \nreceive my death for Allah's Sake, for this is for the Cause of Allah. If He wishes, He will bless the \ncut limbs of my body.\" Then Abu Sarva, 'Ubqa bin Al-Harith went up to him and killed him. It was \nKhubaib who set the tradition of praying for any Muslim to be martyred in captivity (before he is \nexecuted). The Prophet (ﷺ) told his companions of what had happened (to those ten spies) on the same \nday they were martyred. Some Quraish people, being informed of `Asim bin Thabit's death, sent some \nmessengers to bring a part of his body so that his death might be known for certain, for he had \npreviously killed one of their leaders (in the battle of Badr). But Allah sent a swarm of wasps to \nprotect the dead body of `Asim, and they shielded him from the messengers who could not cut \nanything from his body.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 3989, Book 64, Hadith 40","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What lessons can be learned about loyalty and faith from the actions of Asim bin Thabit and his companions?","id":"bukhari-64-39"},{"hadith-eng":"Ibn 'Umar was once told that Said bin Zaid bin 'Amr bin Nufail, one of\n     the Badr warriors, had fallen ill on a Friday.

He drew lots amongst us during one of \nthe Ghazwat which he fought. The lot fell on me and so I proceeded with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) after Allah's \norder of veiling (the women) had been revealed. I was carried (on the back of a camel) in my howdah \nand carried down while still in it (when we came to a halt). So we went on till Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had \nfinished from that Ghazwa of his and returned. \nWhen we approached the city of Medina he announced at night that it was time for departure. So \nwhen they announced the news of departure, I got up and went away from the army camps, and after \nfinishing from the call of nature, I came back to my riding animal. I touched my chest to find that my \nnecklace which was made of Zifar beads (i.e. Yemenite beads partly black and partly white) was \nmissing. So I returned to look for my necklace and my search for it detained me. (In the meanwhile) \nthe people who used to carry me on my camel, came and took my howdah and put it on the back of \nmy camel on which I used to ride, as they considered that I was in it. In those days women were light \nin weight for they did not get fat, and flesh did not cover their bodies in abundance as they used to eat \nonly a little food. Those people therefore, disregarded the lightness of the howdah while lifting and \ncarrying it; and at that time I was still a young girl. They made the camel rise and all of them left \n(along with it). I found my necklace after the army had gone. \nThen I came to their camping place to find no call maker of them, nor one who would respond to the \ncall. So I intended to go to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come \nback to me (in my search). While I was sitting in my resting place, I was overwhelmed by sleep and \nslept. Safwan bin Al-Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he reached my \nplace in the morning, he saw the figure of a sleeping person and he recognized me on seeing me as he \nhad seen me before the order of compulsory veiling (was prescribed). So I woke up when he recited \nIstirja' (i.e. \"Inna li l-lahi wa inna llaihi raji'un\") as soon as he recognized me. I veiled my face with \nmy head cover at once, and by Allah, we did not speak a single word, and I did not hear him saying \nany word besides his Istirja'. He dismounted from his camel and made it kneel down, putting his leg \non its front legs and then I got up and rode on it. Then he set out leading the camel that was carrying \nme till we overtook the army in the extreme heat of midday while they were at a halt (taking a rest). \n(Because of the event) some people brought destruction upon themselves and the one who spread the \nIfk (i.e. slander) more, was `Abdullah bin Ubai Ibn Salul.\" \n(Urwa said, \"The people propagated the slander and talked about it in his (i.e. `Abdullah's) presence \nand he confirmed it and listened to it and asked about it to let it prevail.\" `Urwa also added, \"None \nwas mentioned as members of the slanderous group besides (`Abdullah) except Hassan bin Thabit and \nMistah bin Uthatha and Hamna bint Jahsh along with others about whom I have no knowledge, but \nthey were a group as Allah said. It is said that the one who carried most of the slander was `Abdullah \nbin Ubai bin Salul.\" `Urwa added, \"`Aisha disliked to have Hassan abused in her presence and she \nused to say, 'It was he who said: My father and his (i.e. my father's) father and my honor are all for the \nprotection of Muhammad's honor from you.\"). \n`Aisha added, \"After we returned to Medina, I became ill for a month. The people were propagating \nthe forged statements of the slanderers while I was unaware of anything of all that, but I felt that in my \npresent ailment, I was not receiving the same kindness from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as I used to receive when \nI got sick. (But now) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) would only come, greet me and say,' How is that (lady)?' and \nleave. That roused my doubts, but I did not discover the evil (i.e. slander) till I went out after my \nconvalescence, I went out with Um Mistah to Al-Manasi' where we used to answer the call of nature \nand we used not to go out (to answer the call of nature) except at night, and that was before we had \nlatrines near our houses. And this habit of our concerning evacuating the bowels, was similar to the \nhabits of the old 'Arabs living in the deserts, for it would be troublesome for us to take latrines near \nour houses. So I and Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abu Ruhm bin Al-Muttalib bin `Abd \nManaf, whose mother was the daughter of Sakhr bin 'Amir and the aunt of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and \nwhose son was Mistah bin Uthatha bin `Abbas bin Al-Muttalib, went out. I and Um Mistah returned to \nmy house after we finished answering the call of nature. Um Mistah stumbled by getting her foot \nentangled in her covering sheet and on that she said, 'Let Mistah be ruined!' I said, 'What a hard word \nyou have said. Do you abuse a man who took part in the battle of Badr?' On that she said, 'O you \nHantah! Didn't you hear what he (i.e. Mistah) said? 'I said, 'What did he say?' \nThen she told me the slander of the people of Ifk. So my ailment was aggravated, and when I reached \nmy home, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me, and after greeting me, said, 'How is that (lady)?' I said, 'Will \nyou allow me to go to my parents?' as I wanted to be sure about the news through them. Allah's \nApostle allowed me (and I went to my parents) and asked my mother, 'O mother! What are the people \ntalking about?' She said, 'O my daughter! Don't worry, for scarcely is there a charming woman who is \nloved by her husband and whose husband has other wives besides herself that they (i.e. women) would \nfind faults with her.' I said, 'Subhan-Allah! (I testify the uniqueness of Allah). Are the people really \ntalking in this way?' I kept on weeping that night till dawn I could neither stop weeping nor sleep then \nin the morning again, I kept on weeping. When the Divine Inspiration was delayed. \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid to ask and consult them about divorcing \nme. Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of my innocence, and the respect he preserved in himself for \nme. Usama said, '(O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!) She is your wife and we do not know anything except good \nabout her.' `Ali bin Abi Talib said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah does not put you in difficulty and there \nare plenty of women other than she, yet, ask the maid-servant who will tell you the truth.' On that \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) called Barira (i.e. the maid-servant) and said, 'O Barira! Did you ever see anything \nwhich aroused your suspicion?' Barira said to him, 'By Him Who has sent you with the Truth. I have \nnever seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would conceal, except that she is a young girl who \nsleeps leaving the dough of her family exposed so that the domestic goats come and eat it.' \nSo, on that day, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up on the pulpit and complained about `Abdullah bin Ubai (bin \nSalul) before his companions, saying, 'O you Muslims! Who will relieve me from that man who has \nhurt me with his evil statement about my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my \nfamily and they have blamed a man about whom I know nothing except good and he used never to \nenter my home except with me.' Sa`d bin Mu`adh the brother of Banu `Abd Al-Ashhal got up and \nsaid, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I will relieve you from him; if he is from the tribe of Al-Aus, then I will chop \nhis head off, and if he is from our brothers, i.e. Al-Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your \norder.' On that, a man from Al-Khazraj got up. Um Hassan, his cousin, was from his branch tribe, and \nhe was Sa`d bin Ubada, chief of Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was a pious man, but his love for \nhis tribe goaded him into saying to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh). 'By Allah, you have told a lie; you shall not \nand cannot kill him. If he belonged to your people, you would not wish him to be killed.' \nOn that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin \n'Ubada, 'By Allah! You are a liar! We will surely kill him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on the \nbehalf of hypocrites.' On this, the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al Khazraj got so much excited that they \nwere about to fight while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was standing on the pulpit. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept on \nquietening them till they became silent and so did he. All that day I kept on weeping with my tears \nnever ceasing, and I could never sleep. \nIn the morning my parents were with me and I wept for two nights and a day with my tears never \nceasing and I could never sleep till I thought that my liver would burst from weeping. So, while my \nparents were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked me to grant her admittance. I \nallowed her to come in, and when she came in, she sat down and started weeping with me. While we \nwere in this state, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came, greeted us and sat down. He had never sat with me since that \nday of the slander. A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case. Allah's \nApostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, 'Amma Badu, O `Aisha! I have been informed so-andso \nabout you; if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have \ncommitted a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins \nand asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.' \n(continued...) \n(continuing... 1): -5.462:... ... \nWhen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) finished his speech, my tears ceased flowing completely that I no longer felt a \nsingle drop of tear flowing. I said to my father, 'Reply to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on my behalf concerning \nwhat he has said.' My father said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) .' Then I \nsaid to my mother, 'Reply to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on my behalf concerning what he has said.' She said, 'By \nAllah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).' In spite of the fact that I was a young girl and had \na little knowledge of Qur'an, I said, 'By Allah, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech \nso that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you \nthat I am innocent, you will not believe me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am \ninnocent, you will surely believe me. By Allah, I find no similitude for me and you except that of \nJoseph's father when he said, '(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is \nAllah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.' Then I turned to the other side and lay on my bed; and \nAllah knew then that I was innocent and hoped that Allah would reveal my innocence. But, by Allah, I \nnever thought that Allah would reveal about my case, Divine Inspiration, that would be recited \n(forever) as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something of my concern, \nbut I hoped that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. But, \nby Allah, before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) left his seat and before any of the household left, the Divine \ninspiration came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). \nSo there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him, (when he used to be \ninspired Divinely). The sweat was dropping from his body like pearls though it was a wintry day and \nthat was because of the weighty statement which was being revealed to him. When that state of \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) was over, he got up smiling, and the first word he said was, 'O `Aisha! Allah has \ndeclared your innocence!' Then my Mother said to me, 'Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)). I \nreplied, 'By Allah, I will not go to him, and I praise none but Allah. So Allah revealed the ten Verses:- \n- \"Verily! They who spread the slander Are a gang, among you.............\" (24.11-20) \nAllah revealed those Qur'anic Verses to declare my innocence. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to \ndisburse money for Mistah bin Uthatha because of his relationship to him and his poverty, said, 'By \nAllah, I will never give to Mistah bin Uthatha anything after what he has said about Aisha.' Then \nAllah revealed:-- \n\"And let not those among you who are good and wealthy swear not to give (any sort of help) to their \nkinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allah's cause, let them pardon and \nforgive. Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.\" \n(24.22) \nAbu Bakr As-Siddiq said, 'Yes, by Allah, I would like that Allah forgive me.' and went on giving \nMistah the money he used to give him before. He also added, 'By Allah, I will never deprive him of it \nat all.' \nAisha further said:.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. his wife) about my case. He \nsaid to Zainab, 'What do you know and what did you see?\" She replied, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I refrain \nfrom claiming falsely that I have heard or seen anything. By Allah, I know nothing except good (about \n`Aisha).' From amongst the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) Zainab was my peer (in beauty and in the love she \nreceived from the Prophet) but Allah saved her from that evil because of her piety. Her sister Hamna, \nstarted struggling on her behalf and she was destroyed along with those who were destroyed. The man \nwho was blamed said, 'Subhan-Allah! By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I have never uncovered the \ncover (i.e. veil) of any female.' Later on the man was martyred in Allah's Cause.\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4141, Book 64, Hadith 185","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What was the practice of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) when choosing which wife to accompany him on a journey?","id":"bukhari-64-187"},{"hadith-eng":"Al-Walid bin `Abdul Malik said to me, \"Have you heard that `Ali' was one of those who slandered \n`Aisha?\" I replied, \"No, but two men from your people (named) Abu Salama bin `Abdur-Rahman and \nAbu Bakr bin `Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Harith have informed me that Aisha told them that `Ali \nremained silent about her case.\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4142, Book 64, Hadith 186","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What is the significance of verifying information before accepting it as truth in Islamic teachings?","id":"bukhari-64-188"},{"hadith-eng":"Um Ruman, the mother of `Aisha said that while `Aisha and she were sitting, an Ansari woman came \nand said, \"May Allah harm such and-such a person!\" Um Ruman said to her, What is the matter?\" She \nreplied, \"My son was amongst those who talked of the story (of the Slander).\" Um Ruman said, \"What \nis that?\" She said, \"So-and-so....\" and narrated the whole story.

Ka`b said, \"I did not \nremain behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in any Ghazwa that he fought except the Ghazwa of Tabuk, and I failed \nto take part in the Ghazwa of Badr, but Allah did not admonish anyone who had not participated in it, \nfor in fact, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had gone out in search of the caravan of Quraish till Allah made them (i.e. \nthe Muslims) and their enemy meet without any appointment. I witnessed the night of Al-`Aqaba \n(pledge) with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) when we pledged for Islam, and I would not exchange it for the Badr \nbattle although the Badr battle is more popular amongst the people than it (i.e. Al-`Aqaba pledge). As \nfor my news (in this battle of Tabuk), I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I \nremained behind the Prophet (ﷺ) in that Ghazwa. \nBy Allah, never had I two she-camels before, but I had then at the time of this Ghazwa. Whenever \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) wanted to make a Ghazwa, he used to hide his intention by apparently referring to \ndifferent Ghazwa till it was the time of that Ghazwa (of Tabuk) which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) fought in \nsevere heat, facing, a long journey, desert, and the great number of enemy. So the Prophet (ﷺ) announced \nto the Muslims clearly (their destination) so that they might get prepared for their Ghazwa. So he \ninformed them clearly of the destination he was going to. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was accompanied by a large \nnumber of Muslims who could not be listed in a book namely, a register.\" Ka`b added, \"Any man who \nintended to be absent would think that the matter would remain hidden unless Allah revealed it \nthrough Divine Revelation. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) fought that Ghazwa at the time when the fruits had \nripened and the shade looked pleasant. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his companions prepared for the battle and \nI started to go out in order to get myself ready along with them, but I returned without doing anything. \nI would say to myself, 'I can do that.' So I kept on delaying it every now and then till the people got \nready and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and the Muslims along with him departed, and I had not prepared anything \nfor my departure, and I said, I will prepare myself (for departure) one or two days after him, and then \njoin them.' In the morning following their departure, I went out to get myself ready but returned \nhaving done nothing. Then again in the next morning, I went out to get ready but returned without \ndoing anything. \nSuch was the case with me till they hurried away and the battle was missed (by me). Even then I \nintended to depart to take them over. I wish I had done so! But it was not in my luck. So, after the \ndeparture of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), whenever I went out and walked amongst the people (i.e, the remaining \npersons), it grieved me that I could see none around me, but one accused of hypocrisy or one of those \nweak men whom Allah had excused. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not remember me till he reached Tabuk. \nSo while he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk, he said, 'What did Ka`b do?' A man from Banu \nSalama said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! He has been stopped by his two Burdas (i.e. garments) and his \nlooking at his own flanks with pride.' Then Mu`adh bin Jabal said, 'What a bad thing you have said! \nBy Allah! O Allahs Apostle! We know nothing about him but good.' Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept silent.\" Ka`b \nbin Malik added, \"When I heard that he (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ) was on his way back to Medina. I got \ndipped in my concern, and began to think of false excuses, saying to myself, 'How can I avoid his \nanger tomorrow?' And I took the advice of wise member of my family in this matter. \nWhen it was said that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), had come near all the evil false excuses abandoned from my \nmind and I knew well that I could never come out of this problem by forging a false statement. Then I \ndecided firmly to speak the truth. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) arrived in the morning, and whenever he returned \nfrom a journey., he used to visit the Mosque first of all and offer a two-rak`at prayer therein and then \nsit for the people. So when he had done all that (this time), those who had failed to join the battle (of \nTabuk) came and started offering (false) excuses and taking oaths before him. They were something \nover eighty men; Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) accepted the excuses they had expressed, took their pledge of \nallegiance asked for Allah's Forgiveness for them, and left the secrets of their hearts for Allah to \njudge. \nThen I came to him, and when I greeted him, he smiled a smile of an angry person and then said, \n'Come on.' So I came walking till I sat before him. He said to me, 'What stopped you from joining us. \nHad you not purchased an animal For carrying you?' I answered, \"Yes, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! But by \nAllah, if I were sitting before any person from among the people of the world other than you, I would \nhave avoided his anger with an excuse. \nBy Allah, I have been bestowed with the power of speaking fluently and eloquently, but by Allah, I \nknew well that if today I tell you a lie to seek your favor, Allah would surely make you angry with me \nin the near future, but if I tell you the truth, though you will get angry because of it, I hope for Allah's \nForgiveness. Really, by Allah, there was no excuse for me. By Allah, I had never been stronger or \nwealthier than I was when I remained behind you.' Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'As regards this man, he \nhas surely told the truth. So get up till Allah decides your case.' I got up, and many men of Banu \nSalama followed me and said to me. 'By Allah, we never witnessed you doing any sin before this. \nSurely, you failed to offer excuse to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as the others who did not join him, have offered. \nThe prayer of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to Allah to forgive you would have been sufficient for you.' By Allah, \nthey continued blaming me so much that I intended to return (to the Prophet) and accuse myself of \nhaving told a lie, but I said to them, 'Is there anybody else who has met the same fate as I have?' They \nreplied, 'Yes, there are two men who have said the same thing as you have, and to both of them was \ngiven the same order as given to you.' I said, 'Who are they?' They replied, Murara bin Ar-Rabi Al- \nAmri and Hilal bin Umaiya Al-Waqifi.' By that they mentioned to me two pious men who had \nattended the Ghazwa (Battle) of Badr, and in whom there was an example for me. So I did not change \nmy mind when they mentioned them to me. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbade all the Muslims to talk to us, the \nthree aforesaid persons out of all those who had remained behind in that Ghazwa. So we kept away \nfrom the people and they changed their attitude towards us till the very land (where I lived) appeared \nstrange to me as if I did not know it. \nWe remained in that condition for fifty nights. As regards my two fellows, they remained in their \nhouses and kept on weeping, but I was the youngest of them and the firmest of them, so I used to go \nout and witness the prayers along with the Muslims and roam about in the markets, but none would \ntalk to me, and I would come to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and greet him while he was sitting In his gathering \nafter the prayer, and I would wonder whether the Prophet (ﷺ) did move his lips in return to my greetings \nor not. Then I would offer my prayer near to him and look at him stealthily. When I was busy with my \nprayer, he would turn his face towards me, but when I turned my face to him, he would turn his face \naway from me. When this harsh attitude of the people lasted long, I walked till I scaled the wall of the \ngarden of Abu Qatada who was my cousin and dearest person to me, and I offered my greetings to \nhim. By Allah, he did not return my greetings. I said, 'O Abu Qatada! I beseech you by Allah! Do you \nknow that I love Allah and His Apostle?' He kept quiet. I asked him again, beseeching him by Allah, \nbut he remained silent. Then I asked him again in the Name of Allah. He said, \"Allah and His Apostle \nknow it better.' Thereupon my eyes flowed with tears and I returned and jumped over the wall.\" Ka`b \nadded, \"While I was walking in the market of Medina, suddenly I saw a Nabati (i.e. a Christian \nfarmer) from the Nabatis of Sham who came to sell his grains in Medina, saying, 'Who will lead me to \nKa`b bin Malik?' The people began to point (me) out for him till he came to me and handed me a letter \nfrom the king of Ghassan in which the following was written: \n\"To proceed, I have been informed that your friend (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ) has treated you harshly. \nAnyhow, Allah does not let you live at a place where you feel inferior and your right is lost. So join \nus, and we will console you.\" \nWhen I read it, I said to myself, 'This is also a sort of a test.' Then I took the letter to the oven and \nmade a fire therein by burning it. When forty out of the fifty nights elapsed, behold ! There came to \nme the messenger of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, 'Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) orders you to keep away from your \nwife,' I said, 'Should I divorce her; or else! what should I do?' He said, 'No, only keep aloof from her \nand do not cohabit her.' The Prophet (ﷺ) sent the same message to my two fellows. Then I said to my \nwife. 'Go to your parents and remain with them till Allah gives His Verdict in this matter.\" Ka`b \nadded, \"The wife of Hilal bin Umaiya came to Apostle and said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Hilal bin Umaiya \nis a helpless old man who has no servant to attend on him. Do you dislike that I should serve him? ' \nHe said, 'No (you can serve him) but he should not come near you.' She said, 'By Allah, he has no \ndesire for anything. By, Allah, he has never ceased weeping till his case began till this day of his.' \n(continued...) \n(continuing... 1): -5.702:... ... \nOn that, some of my family members said to me, 'Will you also ask Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to permit your \nwife (to serve you) as he has permitted the wife of Hilal bin Umaiya to serve him?' I said, 'By Allah, I \nwill not ask the permission of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) regarding her, for I do not know What Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \nwould say if I asked him to permit her (to serve me) while I am a young man.' Then I remained in that \nstate for ten more nights after that till the period of fifty nights was completed starting from the time \nwhen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) prohibited the people from talking to us. When I had offered the Fajr prayer on \nthe 50th morning on the roof of one of our houses and while I was sitting in the condition which Allah \ndescribed (in the Qur'an) i.e. my very soul seemed straitened to me and even the earth seemed narrow \nto me for all its spaciousness, there I heard the voice of one who had ascended the mountain of Sala' \ncalling with his loudest voice, 'O Ka`b bin Malik! Be happy (by receiving good tidings).' I fell down \nin prostration before Allah, realizing that relief has come. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had announced the \nacceptance of our repentance by Allah when he had offered the Fajr prayer. The people then went out \nto congratulate us. Some bringers of good tidings went out to my two fellows, and a horseman came to \nme in haste, and a man of Banu Aslam came running and ascended the mountain and his voice was \nswifter than the horse. When he (i.e. the man) whose voice I had heard, came to me conveying the \ngood tidings, I took off my garments and dressed him with them; and by Allah, I owned no other \ngarments than them on that day. Then I borrowed two garments and wore them and went to Allah's \nApostle. \nThe people started receiving me in batches, congratulating me on Allah's Acceptance of my \nrepentance, saying, 'We congratulate you on Allah's Acceptance of your repentance.\" Ka`b further \nsaid, \"When I entered the Mosque. I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sitting with the people around him. Talha bin \nUbaidullah swiftly came to me, shook hands with me and congratulated me. By Allah, none of the \nMuhajirin (i.e. Emigrants) got up for me except him (i.e. Talha), and I will never forget this for \nTalha.\" Ka`b added, \"When I greeted Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) he, his face being bright with joy, said \"Be \nhappy with the best day that you have got ever since your mother delivered you.\" Ka`b added, \"I said \nto the Prophet (ﷺ) 'Is this forgiveness from you or from Allah?' He said, 'No, it is from Allah.' Whenever \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) became happy, his face would shine as if it were a piece of moon, and we all knew \nthat characteristic of him. When I sat before him, I said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Because of the acceptance \nof my repentance I will give up all my wealth as alms for the Sake of Allah and His Apostle. Allah's \nApostle said, 'Keep some of your wealth, as it will be better for you.' I said, 'So I will keep my share \nfrom Khaibar with me,' and added, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah has saved me for telling the truth; so it is \na part of my repentance not to tell but the truth as long as I am alive.

Allah said:-- \"They (i.e. the hypocrites) will swear by Allah to you \nwhen you return to them (up to His Saying) Certainly Allah is not pleased with the rebellious people-- \n\" (9.95-96) Ka`b added, \"We, the three persons, differed altogether from those whose excuses Allah's \nApostle accepted when they swore to him. He took their pledge of allegiance and asked Allah to \nforgive them, but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) left our case pending till Allah gave His Judgment about it. As for \nthat Allah said):-- And to the three (He did for give also) who remained behind.\" (9.118) \nWhat Allah said (in this Verse) does not indicate our failure to take part in the Ghazwa, but it refers to \nthe deferment of making a decision by the Prophet (ﷺ) about our case in contrast to the case of those who \nhad taken an oath before him and he excused them by accepting their excuses.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4418, Book 64, Hadith 440","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What are the consequences of failing to participate in a significant event in Islamic history, such as a battle, without a valid excuse?","id":"bukhari-64-454"},{"hadith-eng":"When the Prophet (ﷺ) passed by Al-Hijr, he said, \"Do not enter the dwelling places of those people who \nwere unjust to themselves unless you enter in a weeping state lest the same calamity as of theirs \nshould befall you.\" Then he covered his head and made his speed fast till he crossed the valley.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4419, Book 64, Hadith 441","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What lesson can be learned from the Prophet's advice about visiting the dwellings of those who were unjust to themselves?","id":"bukhari-64-455"},{"hadith-eng":"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to his companions who were at Al-Hijr, \"Do not enter upon these people who are \nbeing punished, except in a weeping state, lest the same calamity as of theirs should befall you...\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4420, Book 64, Hadith 442","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What is the significance of showing humility and fear when visiting places associated with divine punishment?","id":"bukhari-64-456"},{"hadith-eng":"Al-Mughira bin Shu`ba, said, \"The Prophet (ﷺ) went out to answer the call of nature and (when he had \nfinished) I got up to pour water for him.\" I think that he said that the event had taken place during the \nGhazwa of Tabuk.

He drew lots amongst us during one of \nthe Ghazwat which he fought. The lot fell on me and so I proceeded with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) after Allah's \norder of veiling (the women) had been revealed. I was carried (on the back of a camel) in my howdah \nand carried down while still in it (when we came to a halt). So we went on till Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had \nfinished from that Ghazwa of his and returned. \nWhen we approached the city of Medina he announced at night that it was time for departure. So \nwhen they announced the news of departure, I got up and went away from the army camps, and after \nfinishing from the call of nature, I came back to my riding animal. I touched my chest to find that my \nnecklace which was made of Zifar beads (i.e. Yemenite beads partly black and partly white) was \nmissing. So I returned to look for my necklace and my search for it detained me. (In the meanwhile) \nthe people who used to carry me on my camel, came and took my howdah and put it on the back of \nmy camel on which I used to ride, as they considered that I was in it. In those days women were light \nin weight for they did not get fat, and flesh did not cover their bodies in abundance as they used to eat \nonly a little food. Those people therefore, disregarded the lightness of the howdah while lifting and \ncarrying it; and at that time I was still a young girl. They made the camel rise and all of them left \n(along with it). I found my necklace after the army had gone. \nThen I came to their camping place to find no call maker of them, nor one who would respond to the \ncall. So I intended to go to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come \nback to me (in my search). While I was sitting in my resting place, I was overwhelmed by sleep and \nslept. Safwan bin Al-Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he reached my \nplace in the morning, he saw the figure of a sleeping person and he recognized me on seeing me as he \nhad seen me before the order of compulsory veiling (was prescribed). So I woke up when he recited \nIstirja' (i.e. \"Inna li l-lahi wa inna llaihi raji'un\") as soon as he recognized me. I veiled my face with \nmy head cover at once, and by Allah, we did not speak a single word, and I did not hear him saying \nany word besides his Istirja'. He dismounted from his camel and made it kneel down, putting his leg \non its front legs and then I got up and rode on it. Then he set out leading the camel that was carrying \nme till we overtook the army in the extreme heat of midday while they were at a halt (taking a rest). \n(Because of the event) some people brought destruction upon themselves and the one who spread the \nIfk (i.e. slander) more, was `Abdullah bin Ubai Ibn Salul.\" \n(Urwa said, \"The people propagated the slander and talked about it in his (i.e. `Abdullah's) presence \nand he confirmed it and listened to it and asked about it to let it prevail.\" `Urwa also added, \"None \nwas mentioned as members of the slanderous group besides (`Abdullah) except Hassan bin Thabit and \nMistah bin Uthatha and Hamna bint Jahsh along with others about whom I have no knowledge, but \nthey were a group as Allah said. It is said that the one who carried most of the slander was `Abdullah \nbin Ubai bin Salul.\" `Urwa added, \"`Aisha disliked to have Hassan abused in her presence and she \nused to say, 'It was he who said: My father and his (i.e. my father's) father and my honor are all for the \nprotection of Muhammad's honor from you.\"). \n`Aisha added, \"After we returned to Medina, I became ill for a month. The people were propagating \nthe forged statements of the slanderers while I was unaware of anything of all that, but I felt that in my \npresent ailment, I was not receiving the same kindness from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as I used to receive when \nI got sick. (But now) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) would only come, greet me and say,' How is that (lady)?' and \nleave. That roused my doubts, but I did not discover the evil (i.e. slander) till I went out after my \nconvalescence, I went out with Um Mistah to Al-Manasi' where we used to answer the call of nature \nand we used not to go out (to answer the call of nature) except at night, and that was before we had \nlatrines near our houses. And this habit of our concerning evacuating the bowels, was similar to the \nhabits of the old 'Arabs living in the deserts, for it would be troublesome for us to take latrines near \nour houses. So I and Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abu Ruhm bin Al-Muttalib bin `Abd \nManaf, whose mother was the daughter of Sakhr bin 'Amir and the aunt of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and \nwhose son was Mistah bin Uthatha bin `Abbas bin Al-Muttalib, went out. I and Um Mistah returned to \nmy house after we finished answering the call of nature. Um Mistah stumbled by getting her foot \nentangled in her covering sheet and on that she said, 'Let Mistah be ruined!' I said, 'What a hard word \nyou have said. Do you abuse a man who took part in the battle of Badr?' On that she said, 'O you \nHantah! Didn't you hear what he (i.e. Mistah) said? 'I said, 'What did he say?' \nThen she told me the slander of the people of Ifk. So my ailment was aggravated, and when I reached \nmy home, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me, and after greeting me, said, 'How is that (lady)?' I said, 'Will \nyou allow me to go to my parents?' as I wanted to be sure about the news through them. Allah's \nApostle allowed me (and I went to my parents) and asked my mother, 'O mother! What are the people \ntalking about?' She said, 'O my daughter! Don't worry, for scarcely is there a charming woman who is \nloved by her husband and whose husband has other wives besides herself that they (i.e. women) would \nfind faults with her.' I said, 'Subhan-Allah! (I testify the uniqueness of Allah). Are the people really \ntalking in this way?' I kept on weeping that night till dawn I could neither stop weeping nor sleep then \nin the morning again, I kept on weeping. When the Divine Inspiration was delayed. \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid to ask and consult them about divorcing \nme. Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of my innocence, and the respect he preserved in himself for \nme. Usama said, '(O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!) She is your wife and we do not know anything except good \nabout her.' `Ali bin Abi Talib said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah does not put you in difficulty and there \nare plenty of women other than she, yet, ask the maid-servant who will tell you the truth.' On that \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) called Barira (i.e. the maid-servant) and said, 'O Barira! Did you ever see anything \nwhich aroused your suspicion?' Barira said to him, 'By Him Who has sent you with the Truth. I have \nnever seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would conceal, except that she is a young girl who \nsleeps leaving the dough of her family exposed so that the domestic goats come and eat it.' \nSo, on that day, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up on the pulpit and complained about `Abdullah bin Ubai (bin \nSalul) before his companions, saying, 'O you Muslims! Who will relieve me from that man who has \nhurt me with his evil statement about my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my \nfamily and they have blamed a man about whom I know nothing except good and he used never to \nenter my home except with me.' Sa`d bin Mu`adh the brother of Banu `Abd Al-Ashhal got up and \nsaid, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I will relieve you from him; if he is from the tribe of Al-Aus, then I will chop \nhis head off, and if he is from our brothers, i.e. Al-Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your \norder.' On that, a man from Al-Khazraj got up. Um Hassan, his cousin, was from his branch tribe, and \nhe was Sa`d bin Ubada, chief of Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was a pious man, but his love for \nhis tribe goaded him into saying to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh). 'By Allah, you have told a lie; you shall not \nand cannot kill him. If he belonged to your people, you would not wish him to be killed.' \nOn that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin \n'Ubada, 'By Allah! You are a liar! We will surely kill him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on the \nbehalf of hypocrites.' On this, the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al Khazraj got so much excited that they \nwere about to fight while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was standing on the pulpit. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept on \nquietening them till they became silent and so did he. All that day I kept on weeping with my tears \nnever ceasing, and I could never sleep. \nIn the morning my parents were with me and I wept for two nights and a day with my tears never \nceasing and I could never sleep till I thought that my liver would burst from weeping. So, while my \nparents were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked me to grant her admittance. I \nallowed her to come in, and when she came in, she sat down and started weeping with me. While we \nwere in this state, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came, greeted us and sat down. He had never sat with me since that \nday of the slander. A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case. Allah's \nApostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, 'Amma Badu, O `Aisha! I have been informed so-andso \nabout you; if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have \ncommitted a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins \nand asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.' \n(continued...) \n(continuing... 1): -5.462:... ... \nWhen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) finished his speech, my tears ceased flowing completely that I no longer felt a \nsingle drop of tear flowing. I said to my father, 'Reply to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on my behalf concerning \nwhat he has said.' My father said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) .' Then I \nsaid to my mother, 'Reply to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on my behalf concerning what he has said.' She said, 'By \nAllah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).' In spite of the fact that I was a young girl and had \na little knowledge of Qur'an, I said, 'By Allah, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech \nso that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you \nthat I am innocent, you will not believe me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am \ninnocent, you will surely believe me. By Allah, I find no similitude for me and you except that of \nJoseph's father when he said, '(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is \nAllah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.' Then I turned to the other side and lay on my bed; and \nAllah knew then that I was innocent and hoped that Allah would reveal my innocence. But, by Allah, I \nnever thought that Allah would reveal about my case, Divine Inspiration, that would be recited \n(forever) as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something of my concern, \nbut I hoped that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. But, \nby Allah, before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) left his seat and before any of the household left, the Divine \ninspiration came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). \nSo there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him, (when he used to be \ninspired Divinely). The sweat was dropping from his body like pearls though it was a wintry day and \nthat was because of the weighty statement which was being revealed to him. When that state of \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) was over, he got up smiling, and the first word he said was, 'O `Aisha! Allah has \ndeclared your innocence!' Then my Mother said to me, 'Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)). I \nreplied, 'By Allah, I will not go to him, and I praise none but Allah. So Allah revealed the ten Verses:- \n- \"Verily! They who spread the slander Are a gang, among you.............\" (24.11-20) \nAllah revealed those Qur'anic Verses to declare my innocence. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to \ndisburse money for Mistah bin Uthatha because of his relationship to him and his poverty, said, 'By \nAllah, I will never give to Mistah bin Uthatha anything after what he has said about Aisha.' Then \nAllah revealed:-- \n\"And let not those among you who are good and wealthy swear not to give (any sort of help) to their \nkinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allah's cause, let them pardon and \nforgive. Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.\" \n(24.22) \nAbu Bakr As-Siddiq said, 'Yes, by Allah, I would like that Allah forgive me.' and went on giving \nMistah the money he used to give him before. He also added, 'By Allah, I will never deprive him of it \nat all.' \nAisha further said:.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. his wife) about my case. He \nsaid to Zainab, 'What do you know and what did you see?\" She replied, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I refrain \nfrom claiming falsely that I have heard or seen anything. By Allah, I know nothing except good (about \n`Aisha).' From amongst the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) Zainab was my peer (in beauty and in the love she \nreceived from the Prophet) but Allah saved her from that evil because of her piety. Her sister Hamna, \nstarted struggling on her behalf and she was destroyed along with those who were destroyed. The man \nwho was blamed said, 'Subhan-Allah! By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I have never uncovered the \ncover (i.e. veil) of any female.' Later on the man was martyred in Allah's Cause.\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4141, Book 64, Hadith 185","grade":"","question #":"question #2","question":"How did the incident of the lost necklace lead to the slander against Aisha?","id":"bukhari-64-695"},{"hadith-eng":"Al-Walid bin `Abdul Malik said to me, \"Have you heard that `Ali' was one of those who slandered \n`Aisha?\" I replied, \"No, but two men from your people (named) Abu Salama bin `Abdur-Rahman and \nAbu Bakr bin `Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Harith have informed me that Aisha told them that `Ali \nremained silent about her case.\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4142, Book 64, Hadith 186","grade":"","question #":"question #2","question":"How should one approach historical narratives involving prominent Islamic figures?","id":"bukhari-64-696"},{"hadith-eng":"Um Ruman, the mother of `Aisha said that while `Aisha and she were sitting, an Ansari woman came \nand said, \"May Allah harm such and-such a person!\" Um Ruman said to her, What is the matter?\" She \nreplied, \"My son was amongst those who talked of the story (of the Slander).\" Um Ruman said, \"What \nis that?\" She said, \"So-and-so....\" and narrated the whole story.

Ka`b said, \"I did not \nremain behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in any Ghazwa that he fought except the Ghazwa of Tabuk, and I failed \nto take part in the Ghazwa of Badr, but Allah did not admonish anyone who had not participated in it, \nfor in fact, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had gone out in search of the caravan of Quraish till Allah made them (i.e. \nthe Muslims) and their enemy meet without any appointment. I witnessed the night of Al-`Aqaba \n(pledge) with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) when we pledged for Islam, and I would not exchange it for the Badr \nbattle although the Badr battle is more popular amongst the people than it (i.e. Al-`Aqaba pledge). As \nfor my news (in this battle of Tabuk), I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I \nremained behind the Prophet (ﷺ) in that Ghazwa. \nBy Allah, never had I two she-camels before, but I had then at the time of this Ghazwa. Whenever \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) wanted to make a Ghazwa, he used to hide his intention by apparently referring to \ndifferent Ghazwa till it was the time of that Ghazwa (of Tabuk) which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) fought in \nsevere heat, facing, a long journey, desert, and the great number of enemy. So the Prophet (ﷺ) announced \nto the Muslims clearly (their destination) so that they might get prepared for their Ghazwa. So he \ninformed them clearly of the destination he was going to. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was accompanied by a large \nnumber of Muslims who could not be listed in a book namely, a register.\" Ka`b added, \"Any man who \nintended to be absent would think that the matter would remain hidden unless Allah revealed it \nthrough Divine Revelation. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) fought that Ghazwa at the time when the fruits had \nripened and the shade looked pleasant. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his companions prepared for the battle and \nI started to go out in order to get myself ready along with them, but I returned without doing anything. \nI would say to myself, 'I can do that.' So I kept on delaying it every now and then till the people got \nready and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and the Muslims along with him departed, and I had not prepared anything \nfor my departure, and I said, I will prepare myself (for departure) one or two days after him, and then \njoin them.' In the morning following their departure, I went out to get myself ready but returned \nhaving done nothing. Then again in the next morning, I went out to get ready but returned without \ndoing anything. \nSuch was the case with me till they hurried away and the battle was missed (by me). Even then I \nintended to depart to take them over. I wish I had done so! But it was not in my luck. So, after the \ndeparture of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), whenever I went out and walked amongst the people (i.e, the remaining \npersons), it grieved me that I could see none around me, but one accused of hypocrisy or one of those \nweak men whom Allah had excused. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not remember me till he reached Tabuk. \nSo while he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk, he said, 'What did Ka`b do?' A man from Banu \nSalama said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! He has been stopped by his two Burdas (i.e. garments) and his \nlooking at his own flanks with pride.' Then Mu`adh bin Jabal said, 'What a bad thing you have said! \nBy Allah! O Allahs Apostle! We know nothing about him but good.' Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept silent.\" Ka`b \nbin Malik added, \"When I heard that he (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ) was on his way back to Medina. I got \ndipped in my concern, and began to think of false excuses, saying to myself, 'How can I avoid his \nanger tomorrow?' And I took the advice of wise member of my family in this matter. \nWhen it was said that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), had come near all the evil false excuses abandoned from my \nmind and I knew well that I could never come out of this problem by forging a false statement. Then I \ndecided firmly to speak the truth. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) arrived in the morning, and whenever he returned \nfrom a journey., he used to visit the Mosque first of all and offer a two-rak`at prayer therein and then \nsit for the people. So when he had done all that (this time), those who had failed to join the battle (of \nTabuk) came and started offering (false) excuses and taking oaths before him. They were something \nover eighty men; Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) accepted the excuses they had expressed, took their pledge of \nallegiance asked for Allah's Forgiveness for them, and left the secrets of their hearts for Allah to \njudge. \nThen I came to him, and when I greeted him, he smiled a smile of an angry person and then said, \n'Come on.' So I came walking till I sat before him. He said to me, 'What stopped you from joining us. \nHad you not purchased an animal For carrying you?' I answered, \"Yes, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! But by \nAllah, if I were sitting before any person from among the people of the world other than you, I would \nhave avoided his anger with an excuse. \nBy Allah, I have been bestowed with the power of speaking fluently and eloquently, but by Allah, I \nknew well that if today I tell you a lie to seek your favor, Allah would surely make you angry with me \nin the near future, but if I tell you the truth, though you will get angry because of it, I hope for Allah's \nForgiveness. Really, by Allah, there was no excuse for me. By Allah, I had never been stronger or \nwealthier than I was when I remained behind you.' Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'As regards this man, he \nhas surely told the truth. So get up till Allah decides your case.' I got up, and many men of Banu \nSalama followed me and said to me. 'By Allah, we never witnessed you doing any sin before this. \nSurely, you failed to offer excuse to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as the others who did not join him, have offered. \nThe prayer of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to Allah to forgive you would have been sufficient for you.' By Allah, \nthey continued blaming me so much that I intended to return (to the Prophet) and accuse myself of \nhaving told a lie, but I said to them, 'Is there anybody else who has met the same fate as I have?' They \nreplied, 'Yes, there are two men who have said the same thing as you have, and to both of them was \ngiven the same order as given to you.' I said, 'Who are they?' They replied, Murara bin Ar-Rabi Al- \nAmri and Hilal bin Umaiya Al-Waqifi.' By that they mentioned to me two pious men who had \nattended the Ghazwa (Battle) of Badr, and in whom there was an example for me. So I did not change \nmy mind when they mentioned them to me. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbade all the Muslims to talk to us, the \nthree aforesaid persons out of all those who had remained behind in that Ghazwa. So we kept away \nfrom the people and they changed their attitude towards us till the very land (where I lived) appeared \nstrange to me as if I did not know it. \nWe remained in that condition for fifty nights. As regards my two fellows, they remained in their \nhouses and kept on weeping, but I was the youngest of them and the firmest of them, so I used to go \nout and witness the prayers along with the Muslims and roam about in the markets, but none would \ntalk to me, and I would come to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and greet him while he was sitting In his gathering \nafter the prayer, and I would wonder whether the Prophet (ﷺ) did move his lips in return to my greetings \nor not. Then I would offer my prayer near to him and look at him stealthily. When I was busy with my \nprayer, he would turn his face towards me, but when I turned my face to him, he would turn his face \naway from me. When this harsh attitude of the people lasted long, I walked till I scaled the wall of the \ngarden of Abu Qatada who was my cousin and dearest person to me, and I offered my greetings to \nhim. By Allah, he did not return my greetings. I said, 'O Abu Qatada! I beseech you by Allah! Do you \nknow that I love Allah and His Apostle?' He kept quiet. I asked him again, beseeching him by Allah, \nbut he remained silent. Then I asked him again in the Name of Allah. He said, \"Allah and His Apostle \nknow it better.' Thereupon my eyes flowed with tears and I returned and jumped over the wall.\" Ka`b \nadded, \"While I was walking in the market of Medina, suddenly I saw a Nabati (i.e. a Christian \nfarmer) from the Nabatis of Sham who came to sell his grains in Medina, saying, 'Who will lead me to \nKa`b bin Malik?' The people began to point (me) out for him till he came to me and handed me a letter \nfrom the king of Ghassan in which the following was written: \n\"To proceed, I have been informed that your friend (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ) has treated you harshly. \nAnyhow, Allah does not let you live at a place where you feel inferior and your right is lost. So join \nus, and we will console you.\" \nWhen I read it, I said to myself, 'This is also a sort of a test.' Then I took the letter to the oven and \nmade a fire therein by burning it. When forty out of the fifty nights elapsed, behold ! There came to \nme the messenger of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, 'Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) orders you to keep away from your \nwife,' I said, 'Should I divorce her; or else! what should I do?' He said, 'No, only keep aloof from her \nand do not cohabit her.' The Prophet (ﷺ) sent the same message to my two fellows. Then I said to my \nwife. 'Go to your parents and remain with them till Allah gives His Verdict in this matter.\" Ka`b \nadded, \"The wife of Hilal bin Umaiya came to Apostle and said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Hilal bin Umaiya \nis a helpless old man who has no servant to attend on him. Do you dislike that I should serve him? ' \nHe said, 'No (you can serve him) but he should not come near you.' She said, 'By Allah, he has no \ndesire for anything. By, Allah, he has never ceased weeping till his case began till this day of his.' \n(continued...) \n(continuing... 1): -5.702:... ... \nOn that, some of my family members said to me, 'Will you also ask Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to permit your \nwife (to serve you) as he has permitted the wife of Hilal bin Umaiya to serve him?' I said, 'By Allah, I \nwill not ask the permission of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) regarding her, for I do not know What Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \nwould say if I asked him to permit her (to serve me) while I am a young man.' Then I remained in that \nstate for ten more nights after that till the period of fifty nights was completed starting from the time \nwhen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) prohibited the people from talking to us. When I had offered the Fajr prayer on \nthe 50th morning on the roof of one of our houses and while I was sitting in the condition which Allah \ndescribed (in the Qur'an) i.e. my very soul seemed straitened to me and even the earth seemed narrow \nto me for all its spaciousness, there I heard the voice of one who had ascended the mountain of Sala' \ncalling with his loudest voice, 'O Ka`b bin Malik! Be happy (by receiving good tidings).' I fell down \nin prostration before Allah, realizing that relief has come. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had announced the \nacceptance of our repentance by Allah when he had offered the Fajr prayer. The people then went out \nto congratulate us. Some bringers of good tidings went out to my two fellows, and a horseman came to \nme in haste, and a man of Banu Aslam came running and ascended the mountain and his voice was \nswifter than the horse. When he (i.e. the man) whose voice I had heard, came to me conveying the \ngood tidings, I took off my garments and dressed him with them; and by Allah, I owned no other \ngarments than them on that day. Then I borrowed two garments and wore them and went to Allah's \nApostle. \nThe people started receiving me in batches, congratulating me on Allah's Acceptance of my \nrepentance, saying, 'We congratulate you on Allah's Acceptance of your repentance.\" Ka`b further \nsaid, \"When I entered the Mosque. I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sitting with the people around him. Talha bin \nUbaidullah swiftly came to me, shook hands with me and congratulated me. By Allah, none of the \nMuhajirin (i.e. Emigrants) got up for me except him (i.e. Talha), and I will never forget this for \nTalha.\" Ka`b added, \"When I greeted Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) he, his face being bright with joy, said \"Be \nhappy with the best day that you have got ever since your mother delivered you.\" Ka`b added, \"I said \nto the Prophet (ﷺ) 'Is this forgiveness from you or from Allah?' He said, 'No, it is from Allah.' Whenever \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) became happy, his face would shine as if it were a piece of moon, and we all knew \nthat characteristic of him. When I sat before him, I said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Because of the acceptance \nof my repentance I will give up all my wealth as alms for the Sake of Allah and His Apostle. Allah's \nApostle said, 'Keep some of your wealth, as it will be better for you.' I said, 'So I will keep my share \nfrom Khaibar with me,' and added, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah has saved me for telling the truth; so it is \na part of my repentance not to tell but the truth as long as I am alive. By Allah, I do not know anyone \nof the Muslims whom Allah has helped fortelling the truth more than me. Since I have mentioned that \ntruth to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. I hope that Allah will also save \nme (from telling lies) the rest of my life. So Allah revealed to His Apostle the Verse:-- \n\"Verily, Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants (up to His Saying) And be with \nthose who are true (in word and deed).\" (9.117-119) \nBy Allah, Allah has never bestowed upon me, apart from His guiding me to Islam, a Greater blessing \nthan the fact that I did not tell a lie to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) which would have caused me to perish as those \nwho have told a lie perished, for Allah described those who told lies with the worst description He \never attributed to anybody else. Allah said:-- \"They (i.e. the hypocrites) will swear by Allah to you \nwhen you return to them (up to His Saying) Certainly Allah is not pleased with the rebellious people-- \n\" (9.95-96) Ka`b added, \"We, the three persons, differed altogether from those whose excuses Allah's \nApostle accepted when they swore to him. He took their pledge of allegiance and asked Allah to \nforgive them, but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) left our case pending till Allah gave His Judgment about it. As for \nthat Allah said):-- And to the three (He did for give also) who remained behind.\" (9.118) \nWhat Allah said (in this Verse) does not indicate our failure to take part in the Ghazwa, but it refers to \nthe deferment of making a decision by the Prophet (ﷺ) about our case in contrast to the case of those who \nhad taken an oath before him and he excused them by accepting their excuses.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4418, Book 64, Hadith 440","grade":"","question #":"question #2","question":"How does honesty and truthfulness impact one's relationship with the Prophet and Allah in Islam?","id":"bukhari-64-965"},{"hadith-eng":"When the Prophet (ﷺ) passed by Al-Hijr, he said, \"Do not enter the dwelling places of those people who \nwere unjust to themselves unless you enter in a weeping state lest the same calamity as of theirs \nshould befall you.\" Then he covered his head and made his speed fast till he crossed the valley.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4419, Book 64, Hadith 441","grade":"","question #":"question #2","question":"Why is it important to approach certain historical sites with a sense of humility and reflection?","id":"bukhari-64-966"},{"hadith-eng":"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to his companions who were at Al-Hijr, \"Do not enter upon these people who are \nbeing punished, except in a weeping state, lest the same calamity as of theirs should befall you...\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4420, Book 64, Hadith 442","grade":"","question #":"question #2","question":"Why is it important to reflect on the consequences of past communities who faced divine punishment?","id":"bukhari-64-967"},{"hadith-eng":"Al-Mughira bin Shu`ba, said, \"The Prophet (ﷺ) went out to answer the call of nature and (when he had \nfinished) I got up to pour water for him.\" I think that he said that the event had taken place during the \nGhazwa of Tabuk.

When they reached (a place called) Al-Hadah between 'Usfan and \nMecca, their presence was made known to a sub-tribe of Hudhail called Banu Lihyan. So they sent \nabout one hundred archers after them. The archers traced the footsteps (of the Muslims) till they found \nthe traces of dates which they had eaten at one of their camping places. The archers said, \"These dates \nare of Yathrib (i.e. Medina),\" and went on tracing the Muslims' footsteps. When `Asim and his \ncompanions became aware of them, they took refuge in a (high) place. But the enemy encircled them \nand said, \"Come down and surrender. We give you a solemn promise and covenant that we will not \nkill anyone of you.\" `Asim bin Thabit said, \"O people! As for myself, I will never get down to be \nunder the protection of an infidel. O Allah! Inform your Prophet about us.\" So the archers threw their \narrows at them and martyred `Asim. Three of them came down and surrendered to them, accepting \ntheir promise and covenant and they were Khubaib, Zaid bin Ad-Dathina and another man.

Khubaib remained imprisoned by them till \nthey decided unanimously to kill him. One day Khubaib borrowed from a daughter of Al-Harith, a \nrazor for shaving his pubic hair, and she lent it to him. By chance, while she was inattentive, a little \nson of hers went to him (i.e. Khubaib) and she saw that Khubaib had seated him on his thigh while the \nrazor was in his hand. She was so much terrified that Khubaib noticed her fear and said, \"Are you \nafraid that I will kill him?

When the people got inside, the gate-keeper closed the gate and hung the keys on a \nfixed wooden peg. I got up and took the keys and opened the gate. Some people were staying late at \nnight with Abu Rafi` for a pleasant night chat in a room of his. When his companions of nightly \nentertainment went away, I ascended to him, and whenever I opened a door, I closed it from inside. I \nsaid to myself, 'Should these people discover my presence, they will not be able to catch me till I have \nkilled him.' \nSo I reached him and found him sleeping in a dark house amidst his family, I could not recognize his \nlocation in the house. So I shouted, 'O Abu Rafi`!' Abu Rafi` said, 'Who is it?' I proceeded towards the \nsource of the voice and hit him with the sword, and because of my perplexity, I could not kill him. He \ncried loudly, and I came out of the house and waited for a while, and then went to him again and said, \n'What is this voice, O Abu Rafi`?' He said, 'Woe to your mother! A man in my house has hit me with a \nsword! I again hit him severely but I did not kill him. Then I drove the point of the sword into his \nbelly (and pressed it through) till it touched his back, and I realized that I have killed him. \nI then opened the doors one by one till I reached the staircase, and thinking that I had reached the \nground, I stepped out and fell down and got my leg broken in a moonlit night. I tied my leg with a \nturban and proceeded on till I sat at the gate, and said, 'I will not go out tonight till I know that I have \nkilled him.' So, when (early in the morning) the cock crowed, the announcer of the casualty stood on \nthe wall saying, 'I announce the death of Abu Rafi`, the merchant of Hijaz. Thereupon I went to my \ncompanions and said, 'Let us save ourselves, for Allah has killed Abu Rafi`,' So I (along with my \ncompanions proceeded and) went to the Prophet (ﷺ) and described the whole story to him. \"He said, \n'Stretch out your (broken) leg. I stretched it out and he rubbed it and it became All right as if I had \nnever had any ailment whatsoever.\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4039, Book 64, Hadith 86","grade":"","question #":"question #3","question":"What role did the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) play in healing Abdullah bin Atik's injury?","id":"bukhari-64-1106"},{"hadith-eng":"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sent `Abdullah bin 'Atik and `Abdullah bin `Utba with a group of men to Abu Rafi` \n(to kill him).

By chance, they lost a donkey of theirs and came out carrying a flaming light \nto search for it. I was afraid that they would recognize me, so I covered my head and legs and \npretended to answer the call to nature. The gatekeeper called, 'Whoever wants to come in, should \ncome in before I close the gate.' So I went in and hid myself in a stall of a donkey near the gate of the \ncastle. They took their supper with Abu Rafi` and had a chat till late at night. Then they went back to \ntheir homes. \nWhen the voices vanished and I no longer detected any movement, I came out. I had seen where the \ngate-keeper had kept the key of the castle in a hole in the wall. I took it and unlocked the gate of the \ncastle, saying to myself, 'If these people should notice me, I will run away easily.' Then I locked all \nthe doors of their houses from outside while they were inside, and ascended to Abu Rafi` by a \nstaircase. I saw the house in complete darkness with its light off, and I could not know where the man \nwas. So I called, 'O Abu Rafi`!' He replied, 'Who is it?' I proceeded towards the voice and hit him. He \ncried loudly but my blow was futile. Then I came to him, pretending to help him, saying with a \ndifferent tone of my voice, ' What is wrong with you, O Abu Rafi`?' He said, 'Are you not surprised? \nWoe on your mother! A man has come to me and hit me with a sword!' So again I aimed at him and \nhit him, but the blow proved futile again, and on that Abu Rafi` cried loudly and his wife got up. \nI came again and changed my voice as if I were a helper, and found Abu Rafi` lying straight on his \nback, so I drove the sword into his belly and bent on it till I heard the sound of a bone break. Then I \ncame out, filled with astonishment and went to the staircase to descend, but I fell down from it and got \nmy leg dislocated. I bandaged it and went to my companions limping. I said (to them), 'Go and tell \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) of this good news, but I will not leave (this place) till I hear the news of his (i.e. Abu \nRafi`'s) death.' When dawn broke, an announcer of death got over the wall and announced, 'I convey \nto you the news of Abu Rafi`'s death.'

He drew lots amongst us during one of \nthe Ghazwat which he fought. The lot fell on me and so I proceeded with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) after Allah's \norder of veiling (the women) had been revealed. I was carried (on the back of a camel) in my howdah \nand carried down while still in it (when we came to a halt). So we went on till Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had \nfinished from that Ghazwa of his and returned. \nWhen we approached the city of Medina he announced at night that it was time for departure. So \nwhen they announced the news of departure, I got up and went away from the army camps, and after \nfinishing from the call of nature, I came back to my riding animal. I touched my chest to find that my \nnecklace which was made of Zifar beads (i.e. Yemenite beads partly black and partly white) was \nmissing. So I returned to look for my necklace and my search for it detained me. (In the meanwhile) \nthe people who used to carry me on my camel, came and took my howdah and put it on the back of \nmy camel on which I used to ride, as they considered that I was in it. In those days women were light \nin weight for they did not get fat, and flesh did not cover their bodies in abundance as they used to eat \nonly a little food. Those people therefore, disregarded the lightness of the howdah while lifting and \ncarrying it; and at that time I was still a young girl. They made the camel rise and all of them left \n(along with it). I found my necklace after the army had gone. \nThen I came to their camping place to find no call maker of them, nor one who would respond to the \ncall. So I intended to go to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come \nback to me (in my search). While I was sitting in my resting place, I was overwhelmed by sleep and \nslept. Safwan bin Al-Muattal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he reached my \nplace in the morning, he saw the figure of a sleeping person and he recognized me on seeing me as he \nhad seen me before the order of compulsory veiling (was prescribed). So I woke up when he recited \nIstirja' (i.e. \"Inna li l-lahi wa inna llaihi raji'un\") as soon as he recognized me. I veiled my face with \nmy head cover at once, and by Allah, we did not speak a single word, and I did not hear him saying \nany word besides his Istirja'. He dismounted from his camel and made it kneel down, putting his leg \non its front legs and then I got up and rode on it. Then he set out leading the camel that was carrying \nme till we overtook the army in the extreme heat of midday while they were at a halt (taking a rest). \n(Because of the event) some people brought destruction upon themselves and the one who spread the \nIfk (i.e. slander) more, was `Abdullah bin Ubai Ibn Salul.\" \n(Urwa said, \"The people propagated the slander and talked about it in his (i.e. `Abdullah's) presence \nand he confirmed it and listened to it and asked about it to let it prevail.\" `Urwa also added, \"None \nwas mentioned as members of the slanderous group besides (`Abdullah) except Hassan bin Thabit and \nMistah bin Uthatha and Hamna bint Jahsh along with others about whom I have no knowledge, but \nthey were a group as Allah said. It is said that the one who carried most of the slander was `Abdullah \nbin Ubai bin Salul.\" `Urwa added, \"`Aisha disliked to have Hassan abused in her presence and she \nused to say, 'It was he who said: My father and his (i.e. my father's) father and my honor are all for the \nprotection of Muhammad's honor from you.\"). \n`Aisha added, \"After we returned to Medina, I became ill for a month. The people were propagating \nthe forged statements of the slanderers while I was unaware of anything of all that, but I felt that in my \npresent ailment, I was not receiving the same kindness from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as I used to receive when \nI got sick. (But now) Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) would only come, greet me and say,' How is that (lady)?' and \nleave. That roused my doubts, but I did not discover the evil (i.e. slander) till I went out after my \nconvalescence, I went out with Um Mistah to Al-Manasi' where we used to answer the call of nature \nand we used not to go out (to answer the call of nature) except at night, and that was before we had \nlatrines near our houses. And this habit of our concerning evacuating the bowels, was similar to the \nhabits of the old 'Arabs living in the deserts, for it would be troublesome for us to take latrines near \nour houses. So I and Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abu Ruhm bin Al-Muttalib bin `Abd \nManaf, whose mother was the daughter of Sakhr bin 'Amir and the aunt of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and \nwhose son was Mistah bin Uthatha bin `Abbas bin Al-Muttalib, went out. I and Um Mistah returned to \nmy house after we finished answering the call of nature. Um Mistah stumbled by getting her foot \nentangled in her covering sheet and on that she said, 'Let Mistah be ruined!' I said, 'What a hard word \nyou have said. Do you abuse a man who took part in the battle of Badr?' On that she said, 'O you \nHantah! Didn't you hear what he (i.e. Mistah) said? 'I said, 'What did he say?' \nThen she told me the slander of the people of Ifk. So my ailment was aggravated, and when I reached \nmy home, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me, and after greeting me, said, 'How is that (lady)?' I said, 'Will \nyou allow me to go to my parents?' as I wanted to be sure about the news through them. Allah's \nApostle allowed me (and I went to my parents) and asked my mother, 'O mother! What are the people \ntalking about?' She said, 'O my daughter! Don't worry, for scarcely is there a charming woman who is \nloved by her husband and whose husband has other wives besides herself that they (i.e. women) would \nfind faults with her.' I said, 'Subhan-Allah! (I testify the uniqueness of Allah). Are the people really \ntalking in this way?' I kept on weeping that night till dawn I could neither stop weeping nor sleep then \nin the morning again, I kept on weeping. When the Divine Inspiration was delayed. \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid to ask and consult them about divorcing \nme. Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of my innocence, and the respect he preserved in himself for \nme. Usama said, '(O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!) She is your wife and we do not know anything except good \nabout her.' `Ali bin Abi Talib said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah does not put you in difficulty and there \nare plenty of women other than she, yet, ask the maid-servant who will tell you the truth.' On that \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) called Barira (i.e. the maid-servant) and said, 'O Barira! Did you ever see anything \nwhich aroused your suspicion?' Barira said to him, 'By Him Who has sent you with the Truth. I have \nnever seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would conceal, except that she is a young girl who \nsleeps leaving the dough of her family exposed so that the domestic goats come and eat it.' \nSo, on that day, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up on the pulpit and complained about `Abdullah bin Ubai (bin \nSalul) before his companions, saying, 'O you Muslims! Who will relieve me from that man who has \nhurt me with his evil statement about my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my \nfamily and they have blamed a man about whom I know nothing except good and he used never to \nenter my home except with me.' Sa`d bin Mu`adh the brother of Banu `Abd Al-Ashhal got up and \nsaid, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I will relieve you from him; if he is from the tribe of Al-Aus, then I will chop \nhis head off, and if he is from our brothers, i.e. Al-Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill your \norder.' On that, a man from Al-Khazraj got up. Um Hassan, his cousin, was from his branch tribe, and \nhe was Sa`d bin Ubada, chief of Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was a pious man, but his love for \nhis tribe goaded him into saying to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh). 'By Allah, you have told a lie; you shall not \nand cannot kill him. If he belonged to your people, you would not wish him to be killed.' \nOn that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin \n'Ubada, 'By Allah! You are a liar! We will surely kill him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on the \nbehalf of hypocrites.' On this, the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al Khazraj got so much excited that they \nwere about to fight while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was standing on the pulpit. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept on \nquietening them till they became silent and so did he. All that day I kept on weeping with my tears \nnever ceasing, and I could never sleep. \nIn the morning my parents were with me and I wept for two nights and a day with my tears never \nceasing and I could never sleep till I thought that my liver would burst from weeping. So, while my \nparents were sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked me to grant her admittance. I \nallowed her to come in, and when she came in, she sat down and started weeping with me. While we \nwere in this state, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came, greeted us and sat down. He had never sat with me since that \nday of the slander. A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case. Allah's \nApostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, 'Amma Badu, O `Aisha! I have been informed so-andso \nabout you; if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have \ncommitted a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins \nand asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.' \n(continued...) \n(continuing... 1): -5.462:... ... \nWhen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) finished his speech, my tears ceased flowing completely that I no longer felt a \nsingle drop of tear flowing. I said to my father, 'Reply to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on my behalf concerning \nwhat he has said.' My father said, 'By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) .' Then I \nsaid to my mother, 'Reply to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on my behalf concerning what he has said.' She said, 'By \nAllah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).' In spite of the fact that I was a young girl and had \na little knowledge of Qur'an, I said, 'By Allah, no doubt I know that you heard this (slanderous) speech \nso that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you \nthat I am innocent, you will not believe me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am \ninnocent, you will surely believe me. By Allah, I find no similitude for me and you except that of \nJoseph's father when he said, '(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is \nAllah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.' Then I turned to the other side and lay on my bed; and \nAllah knew then that I was innocent and hoped that Allah would reveal my innocence. But, by Allah, I \nnever thought that Allah would reveal about my case, Divine Inspiration, that would be recited \n(forever) as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something of my concern, \nbut I hoped that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) might have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. But, \nby Allah, before Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) left his seat and before any of the household left, the Divine \ninspiration came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). \nSo there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him, (when he used to be \ninspired Divinely). The sweat was dropping from his body like pearls though it was a wintry day and \nthat was because of the weighty statement which was being revealed to him. When that state of \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) was over, he got up smiling, and the first word he said was, 'O `Aisha! Allah has \ndeclared your innocence!' Then my Mother said to me, 'Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)). I \nreplied, 'By Allah, I will not go to him, and I praise none but Allah. So Allah revealed the ten Verses:- \n- \"Verily! They who spread the slander Are a gang, among you.............\" (24.11-20) \nAllah revealed those Qur'anic Verses to declare my innocence. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to \ndisburse money for Mistah bin Uthatha because of his relationship to him and his poverty, said, 'By \nAllah, I will never give to Mistah bin Uthatha anything after what he has said about Aisha.' Then \nAllah revealed:-- \n\"And let not those among you who are good and wealthy swear not to give (any sort of help) to their \nkinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allah's cause, let them pardon and \nforgive. Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.\" \n(24.22) \nAbu Bakr As-Siddiq said, 'Yes, by Allah, I would like that Allah forgive me.' and went on giving \nMistah the money he used to give him before. He also added, 'By Allah, I will never deprive him of it \nat all.' \nAisha further said:.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. his wife) about my case. He \nsaid to Zainab, 'What do you know and what did you see?\" She replied, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I refrain \nfrom claiming falsely that I have heard or seen anything. By Allah, I know nothing except good (about \n`Aisha).' From amongst the wives of the Prophet (ﷺ) Zainab was my peer (in beauty and in the love she \nreceived from the Prophet) but Allah saved her from that evil because of her piety. Her sister Hamna, \nstarted struggling on her behalf and she was destroyed along with those who were destroyed. The man \nwho was blamed said, 'Subhan-Allah! By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I have never uncovered the \ncover (i.e. veil) of any female.' Later on the man was martyred in Allah's Cause.\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4141, Book 64, Hadith 185","grade":"","question #":"question #3","question":"What was the reaction of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) and his companions to the slander against Aisha, and how was her innocence eventually proven?","id":"bukhari-64-1208"},{"hadith-eng":"Al-Walid bin `Abdul Malik said to me, \"Have you heard that `Ali' was one of those who slandered \n`Aisha?\" I replied, \"No, but two men from your people (named) Abu Salama bin `Abdur-Rahman and \nAbu Bakr bin `Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Harith have informed me that Aisha told them that `Ali \nremained silent about her case.\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4142, Book 64, Hadith 186","grade":"","question #":"question #3","question":"What is the importance of maintaining silence or neutrality in sensitive matters according to Islamic principles?","id":"bukhari-64-1209"},{"hadith-eng":"Um Ruman, the mother of `Aisha said that while `Aisha and she were sitting, an Ansari woman came \nand said, \"May Allah harm such and-such a person!\" Um Ruman said to her, What is the matter?\" She \nreplied, \"My son was amongst those who talked of the story (of the Slander).\" Um Ruman said, \"What \nis that?\" She said, \"So-and-so....\" and narrated the whole story.

Ka`b said, \"I did not \nremain behind Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in any Ghazwa that he fought except the Ghazwa of Tabuk, and I failed \nto take part in the Ghazwa of Badr, but Allah did not admonish anyone who had not participated in it, \nfor in fact, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had gone out in search of the caravan of Quraish till Allah made them (i.e. \nthe Muslims) and their enemy meet without any appointment. I witnessed the night of Al-`Aqaba \n(pledge) with Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) when we pledged for Islam, and I would not exchange it for the Badr \nbattle although the Badr battle is more popular amongst the people than it (i.e. Al-`Aqaba pledge). As \nfor my news (in this battle of Tabuk), I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I \nremained behind the Prophet (ﷺ) in that Ghazwa. \nBy Allah, never had I two she-camels before, but I had then at the time of this Ghazwa. Whenever \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) wanted to make a Ghazwa, he used to hide his intention by apparently referring to \ndifferent Ghazwa till it was the time of that Ghazwa (of Tabuk) which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) fought in \nsevere heat, facing, a long journey, desert, and the great number of enemy. So the Prophet (ﷺ) announced \nto the Muslims clearly (their destination) so that they might get prepared for their Ghazwa. So he \ninformed them clearly of the destination he was going to. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was accompanied by a large \nnumber of Muslims who could not be listed in a book namely, a register.\" Ka`b added, \"Any man who \nintended to be absent would think that the matter would remain hidden unless Allah revealed it \nthrough Divine Revelation. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) fought that Ghazwa at the time when the fruits had \nripened and the shade looked pleasant. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his companions prepared for the battle and \nI started to go out in order to get myself ready along with them, but I returned without doing anything. \nI would say to myself, 'I can do that.' So I kept on delaying it every now and then till the people got \nready and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and the Muslims along with him departed, and I had not prepared anything \nfor my departure, and I said, I will prepare myself (for departure) one or two days after him, and then \njoin them.' In the morning following their departure, I went out to get myself ready but returned \nhaving done nothing. Then again in the next morning, I went out to get ready but returned without \ndoing anything. \nSuch was the case with me till they hurried away and the battle was missed (by me). Even then I \nintended to depart to take them over. I wish I had done so! But it was not in my luck. So, after the \ndeparture of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), whenever I went out and walked amongst the people (i.e, the remaining \npersons), it grieved me that I could see none around me, but one accused of hypocrisy or one of those \nweak men whom Allah had excused. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) did not remember me till he reached Tabuk. \nSo while he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk, he said, 'What did Ka`b do?' A man from Banu \nSalama said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! He has been stopped by his two Burdas (i.e. garments) and his \nlooking at his own flanks with pride.' Then Mu`adh bin Jabal said, 'What a bad thing you have said! \nBy Allah! O Allahs Apostle! We know nothing about him but good.' Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) kept silent.\" Ka`b \nbin Malik added, \"When I heard that he (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ) was on his way back to Medina. I got \ndipped in my concern, and began to think of false excuses, saying to myself, 'How can I avoid his \nanger tomorrow?' And I took the advice of wise member of my family in this matter. \nWhen it was said that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), had come near all the evil false excuses abandoned from my \nmind and I knew well that I could never come out of this problem by forging a false statement. Then I \ndecided firmly to speak the truth. So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) arrived in the morning, and whenever he returned \nfrom a journey., he used to visit the Mosque first of all and offer a two-rak`at prayer therein and then \nsit for the people. So when he had done all that (this time), those who had failed to join the battle (of \nTabuk) came and started offering (false) excuses and taking oaths before him. They were something \nover eighty men; Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) accepted the excuses they had expressed, took their pledge of \nallegiance asked for Allah's Forgiveness for them, and left the secrets of their hearts for Allah to \njudge. \nThen I came to him, and when I greeted him, he smiled a smile of an angry person and then said, \n'Come on.' So I came walking till I sat before him. He said to me, 'What stopped you from joining us. \nHad you not purchased an animal For carrying you?' I answered, \"Yes, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! But by \nAllah, if I were sitting before any person from among the people of the world other than you, I would \nhave avoided his anger with an excuse. \nBy Allah, I have been bestowed with the power of speaking fluently and eloquently, but by Allah, I \nknew well that if today I tell you a lie to seek your favor, Allah would surely make you angry with me \nin the near future, but if I tell you the truth, though you will get angry because of it, I hope for Allah's \nForgiveness. Really, by Allah, there was no excuse for me. By Allah, I had never been stronger or \nwealthier than I was when I remained behind you.' Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'As regards this man, he \nhas surely told the truth. So get up till Allah decides your case.' I got up, and many men of Banu \nSalama followed me and said to me. 'By Allah, we never witnessed you doing any sin before this. \nSurely, you failed to offer excuse to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) as the others who did not join him, have offered. \nThe prayer of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to Allah to forgive you would have been sufficient for you.' By Allah, \nthey continued blaming me so much that I intended to return (to the Prophet) and accuse myself of \nhaving told a lie, but I said to them, 'Is there anybody else who has met the same fate as I have?' They \nreplied, 'Yes, there are two men who have said the same thing as you have, and to both of them was \ngiven the same order as given to you.' I said, 'Who are they?' They replied, Murara bin Ar-Rabi Al- \nAmri and Hilal bin Umaiya Al-Waqifi.' By that they mentioned to me two pious men who had \nattended the Ghazwa (Battle) of Badr, and in whom there was an example for me. So I did not change \nmy mind when they mentioned them to me. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) forbade all the Muslims to talk to us, the \nthree aforesaid persons out of all those who had remained behind in that Ghazwa. So we kept away \nfrom the people and they changed their attitude towards us till the very land (where I lived) appeared \nstrange to me as if I did not know it. \nWe remained in that condition for fifty nights. As regards my two fellows, they remained in their \nhouses and kept on weeping, but I was the youngest of them and the firmest of them, so I used to go \nout and witness the prayers along with the Muslims and roam about in the markets, but none would \ntalk to me, and I would come to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and greet him while he was sitting In his gathering \nafter the prayer, and I would wonder whether the Prophet (ﷺ) did move his lips in return to my greetings \nor not. Then I would offer my prayer near to him and look at him stealthily. When I was busy with my \nprayer, he would turn his face towards me, but when I turned my face to him, he would turn his face \naway from me. When this harsh attitude of the people lasted long, I walked till I scaled the wall of the \ngarden of Abu Qatada who was my cousin and dearest person to me, and I offered my greetings to \nhim. By Allah, he did not return my greetings. I said, 'O Abu Qatada! I beseech you by Allah! Do you \nknow that I love Allah and His Apostle?' He kept quiet. I asked him again, beseeching him by Allah, \nbut he remained silent. Then I asked him again in the Name of Allah. He said, \"Allah and His Apostle \nknow it better.' Thereupon my eyes flowed with tears and I returned and jumped over the wall.\" Ka`b \nadded, \"While I was walking in the market of Medina, suddenly I saw a Nabati (i.e. a Christian \nfarmer) from the Nabatis of Sham who came to sell his grains in Medina, saying, 'Who will lead me to \nKa`b bin Malik?' The people began to point (me) out for him till he came to me and handed me a letter \nfrom the king of Ghassan in which the following was written: \n\"To proceed, I have been informed that your friend (i.e. the Prophet (ﷺ) ) has treated you harshly. \nAnyhow, Allah does not let you live at a place where you feel inferior and your right is lost. So join \nus, and we will console you.\" \nWhen I read it, I said to myself, 'This is also a sort of a test.' Then I took the letter to the oven and \nmade a fire therein by burning it. When forty out of the fifty nights elapsed, behold ! There came to \nme the messenger of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, 'Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) orders you to keep away from your \nwife,' I said, 'Should I divorce her; or else! what should I do?' He said, 'No, only keep aloof from her \nand do not cohabit her.' The Prophet (ﷺ) sent the same message to my two fellows. Then I said to my \nwife. 'Go to your parents and remain with them till Allah gives His Verdict in this matter.\" Ka`b \nadded, \"The wife of Hilal bin Umaiya came to Apostle and said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Hilal bin Umaiya \nis a helpless old man who has no servant to attend on him. Do you dislike that I should serve him? ' \nHe said, 'No (you can serve him) but he should not come near you.' She said, 'By Allah, he has no \ndesire for anything. By, Allah, he has never ceased weeping till his case began till this day of his.' \n(continued...) \n(continuing... 1): -5.702:... ... \nOn that, some of my family members said to me, 'Will you also ask Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) to permit your \nwife (to serve you) as he has permitted the wife of Hilal bin Umaiya to serve him?' I said, 'By Allah, I \nwill not ask the permission of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) regarding her, for I do not know What Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \nwould say if I asked him to permit her (to serve me) while I am a young man.' Then I remained in that \nstate for ten more nights after that till the period of fifty nights was completed starting from the time \nwhen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) prohibited the people from talking to us. When I had offered the Fajr prayer on \nthe 50th morning on the roof of one of our houses and while I was sitting in the condition which Allah \ndescribed (in the Qur'an) i.e. my very soul seemed straitened to me and even the earth seemed narrow \nto me for all its spaciousness, there I heard the voice of one who had ascended the mountain of Sala' \ncalling with his loudest voice, 'O Ka`b bin Malik! Be happy (by receiving good tidings).' I fell down \nin prostration before Allah, realizing that relief has come. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had announced the \nacceptance of our repentance by Allah when he had offered the Fajr prayer. The people then went out \nto congratulate us. Some bringers of good tidings went out to my two fellows, and a horseman came to \nme in haste, and a man of Banu Aslam came running and ascended the mountain and his voice was \nswifter than the horse. When he (i.e. the man) whose voice I had heard, came to me conveying the \ngood tidings, I took off my garments and dressed him with them; and by Allah, I owned no other \ngarments than them on that day. Then I borrowed two garments and wore them and went to Allah's \nApostle. \nThe people started receiving me in batches, congratulating me on Allah's Acceptance of my \nrepentance, saying, 'We congratulate you on Allah's Acceptance of your repentance.\" Ka`b further \nsaid, \"When I entered the Mosque. I saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sitting with the people around him. Talha bin \nUbaidullah swiftly came to me, shook hands with me and congratulated me. By Allah, none of the \nMuhajirin (i.e. Emigrants) got up for me except him (i.e. Talha), and I will never forget this for \nTalha.\" Ka`b added, \"When I greeted Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) he, his face being bright with joy, said \"Be \nhappy with the best day that you have got ever since your mother delivered you.\" Ka`b added, \"I said \nto the Prophet (ﷺ) 'Is this forgiveness from you or from Allah?' He said, 'No, it is from Allah.' Whenever \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) became happy, his face would shine as if it were a piece of moon, and we all knew \nthat characteristic of him. When I sat before him, I said, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Because of the acceptance \nof my repentance I will give up all my wealth as alms for the Sake of Allah and His Apostle. Allah's \nApostle said, 'Keep some of your wealth, as it will be better for you.' I said, 'So I will keep my share \nfrom Khaibar with me,' and added, 'O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah has saved me for telling the truth; so it is \na part of my repentance not to tell but the truth as long as I am alive. By Allah, I do not know anyone \nof the Muslims whom Allah has helped fortelling the truth more than me. Since I have mentioned that \ntruth to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. I hope that Allah will also save \nme (from telling lies) the rest of my life. So Allah revealed to His Apostle the Verse:-- \n\"Verily, Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants (up to His Saying) And be with \nthose who are true (in word and deed).\" (9.117-119) \nBy Allah, Allah has never bestowed upon me, apart from His guiding me to Islam, a Greater blessing \nthan the fact that I did not tell a lie to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) which would have caused me to perish as those \nwho have told a lie perished, for Allah described those who told lies with the worst description He \never attributed to anybody else. Allah said:-- \"They (i.e. the hypocrites) will swear by Allah to you \nwhen you return to them (up to His Saying) Certainly Allah is not pleased with the rebellious people-- \n\" (9.95-96) Ka`b added, \"We, the three persons, differed altogether from those whose excuses Allah's \nApostle accepted when they swore to him. He took their pledge of allegiance and asked Allah to \nforgive them, but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) left our case pending till Allah gave His Judgment about it. As for \nthat Allah said):-- And to the three (He did for give also) who remained behind.\" (9.118) \nWhat Allah said (in this Verse) does not indicate our failure to take part in the Ghazwa, but it refers to \nthe deferment of making a decision by the Prophet (ﷺ) about our case in contrast to the case of those who \nhad taken an oath before him and he excused them by accepting their excuses.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4418, Book 64, Hadith 440","grade":"","question #":"question #3","question":"What is the significance of repentance and forgiveness in Islam, and how is it demonstrated in the story of Ka'b bin Malik?","id":"bukhari-64-1481"},{"hadith-eng":"When the Prophet (ﷺ) passed by Al-Hijr, he said, \"Do not enter the dwelling places of those people who \nwere unjust to themselves unless you enter in a weeping state lest the same calamity as of theirs \nshould befall you.\" Then he covered his head and made his speed fast till he crossed the valley.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4419, Book 64, Hadith 441","grade":"","question #":"question #3","question":"What actions did the Prophet take when passing by the dwellings of those who faced calamity, and what can be inferred from these actions?","id":"bukhari-64-1482"},{"hadith-eng":"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to his companions who were at Al-Hijr, \"Do not enter upon these people who are \nbeing punished, except in a weeping state, lest the same calamity as of theirs should befall you...\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4420, Book 64, Hadith 442","grade":"","question #":"question #3","question":"How can visiting historical sites of punishment serve as a reminder for personal conduct and spirituality?","id":"bukhari-64-1483"},{"hadith-eng":"Al-Mughira bin Shu`ba, said, \"The Prophet (ﷺ) went out to answer the call of nature and (when he had \nfinished) I got up to pour water for him.\" I think that he said that the event had taken place during the \nGhazwa of Tabuk.
