Heraclius said, 'Is there anyone from the people of this man who claims to be a \nprophet?' The people replied, 'Yes.' So I along with some of Quraishi men were called and we entered \nupon Heraclius, and we were seated in front of him. Then he said, 'Who amongst you is the nearest \nrelative to the man who claims to be a prophet?' So they made me sit in front of him and made my \ncompanions sit behind me. \nThen he called upon his translator and said (to him). 'Tell them ( i.e. Abu Sufyan's companions) that I \nam going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyan) regarding that man who claims to be a prophet. So, if he tell me \na lie, they should contradict him (instantly).' By Allah, had I not been afraid that my companions \nwould consider me a liar, I would have told lies. \nHeraclius then said to his translator, 'Ask him: What is his (i.e. the Prophet's) family status amongst \nyou? I said, 'He belongs to a noble family amongst us.\" \nHeraclius said, 'Was any of his ancestors a king?' I said, 'No.' \nHe said, 'Did you ever accuse him of telling lies before his saying what he has said?' I said, 'No.' \nHe said, 'Do the nobles follow him or the poor people?' I said, 'It is the poor who followed him.' \nHe said, 'Is the number of his follower increasing or decreasing?' I said, 'The are increasing.' \nHe said, 'Does anyone renounce his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it?' I \nsaid, 'No.' \nHe said, 'Did you fight with him?' I replied, 'Yes.' \nHe said, 'How was your fighting with him?' I said, 'The fighting between us was undecided and \nvictory was shared by him and us by turns. He inflicts casualties upon us and we inflict casualties \nupon him.' \nHe said, 'Did he ever betray?'

Thereupon I thought \nthat had one of his fore-fathers been a king, I would have said that he (i.e. Muhammad) was seeking to \nrule the kingdom of his fore-fathers. \nThen I asked you regarding his followers, whether they were the noble or the poor among the people, \nand you said that they were only the poor (who follow him). In fact, such are the followers of the \nApostles. \nThen I asked you whether you have ever accused him of telling lies before saying what he said, and \nyour reply was in the negative.

And such is Faith when it mixes with the \ncheerfulness of the hearts. \nThen I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You claimed that they were \nincreasing. That is the way of true faith till it is complete. \nThen I asked you whether you had ever fought with him, and you claimed that you had fought with \nhim and the battle between you and him was undecided and the victory was shared by you and him in \nturns; he inflicted casual ties upon you and you inflicted casualties upon them. Such is the case with \nthe Apostles; they are out to test and the final victory is for them. \nThen I asked you whether he had ever betrayed; you claimed that he had never betrayed. I need, \nApostles never betray. \nThen I asked you whether anyone had said this statement before him; and you denied that.

If I were \ncertain that I can reach him, I would like to meet him and if I were with him, I would wash his feet; \nand his kingdom will expand (surely to what is under my feet.' Then Heraclius asked for the letter of \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) and read it wherein was written: \n\"In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

'His parents were believers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and we (Khadir) feared \r\nlest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion and disbelief.' (18.80) (i.e. that their love for him \r\nwould urge them to follow him in his religion, 'so we (Khadir) desired that their Lord should change \r\nhim for them for one better in righteousness and near to mercy' (18:81).

Ubai bin Ka`b narrated to us \nthat Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'Moses got up to deliver a sermon before Bani Israel and he was asked, 'Who \nis the most learned person among the people?' Moses replied, 'I (am the most learned).' Allah then \nadmonished Moses for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah only (Then) came the Divine \nInspiration:-- 'Yes, one of Our slaves at the junction of the two seas is more learned than you.' \nMoses said, 'O my Lord ! How can meet him?' Allah said, 'Take a fish in a basket and wherever the \nfish is lost, follow it (you will find him at that place). So Moses set out along with his attendant \nYusha` bin Noon, and they carried with them a fish till they reached a rock and rested there. Moses \nput his head down and slept. (Sufyan, a sub-narrator said that somebody other than `Amr said) 'At the \nrock there was a water spring called 'Al-Hayat' and none came in touch with its water but became \nalive. So some of the water of that spring fell over that fish, so it moved and slipped out of the basket \nand entered the sea. When Moses woke up, he asked his attendant, 'Bring our early meal' (18.62). \nThe narrator added: Moses did not suffer from fatigue except after he had passed the place he had \nbeen ordered to observe. His attendant Yusha` bin Noon said to him, 'Do you remember (what \nhappened) when we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget (about) the fish ...' (18.63) The \nnarrator added: So they came back, retracing their steps and then they found in the sea, the way of the \nfish looking like a tunnel. So there was an astonishing event for his attendant, and there was tunnel for \nthe fish. When they reached the rock, they found a man covered with a garment. Moses greeted him. \nThe man said astonishingly, 'Is there any such greeting in your land?' Moses said, 'I am Moses.' The \nman said, 'Moses of Bani Israel?' Moses said, 'Yes,' and added, 'may I follow you so that you teach me \nsomething of the Knowledge which you have been taught?' (18.66). Al-Khadir said to him, 'O Moses! \nYou have something of Allah's knowledge which Allah has taught you and which I do not know; and I \nhave something of Allah's knowledge which Allah has taught me and which you do not know.' Moses \nsaid, 'But I will follow you.' Al-Khadir said, 'Then if you follow me, ask me no question about \nanything until I myself speak to you concerning it.' (18.70). After that both of them proceeded along \nthe seashore. There passed by them a boat whose crew recognized Al-Khadir and received them on \nboard free of charge. So they both got on board. A sparrow came and sat on the edge of the boat and \ndipped its beak unto the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses. 'My knowledge and your knowledge and all the \ncreation's knowledge compared to Allah's knowledge is not more than the water taken by this \nsparrow's beak.' \nThen Moses was startled by Al-Khadir's action of taking an adze and scuttling the boat with it. Moses \nsaid to him, 'These people gave us a free lift, but you intentionally scuttled their boat so as to drown \nthem. Surely you have...' (18.71) Then they both proceeded and found a boy playing with other \nboys. Al-Khadir took hold of him by the head and cut it off. Moses said to him, 'Have you killed an \ninnocent soul who has killed nobody? Surely you have done an illegal thing! ' (18.74) He said, \n\"Didn't I tell you that you will not be able to have patient with me up to ..but they refused to entertain \nthem as their guests. There they found a wall therein at the point of collapsing.' (18.75-77) Al-Khadir \nmoved his hand thus and set it upright (repaired it). Moses said to him, 'When we entered this town, \nthey neither gave us hospitality nor fed us; if you had wished, you could have taken wages for it,' Al- \nKhadir said, 'This is the parting between you and me I will tell you the interpretation of (those things) \nabout which you were unable to hold patience.'...(18.78) \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'We wished that Moses could have been more patient so that He (Allah) could \nhave described to us more about their story.'

After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one \nmonth while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not \naware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer \nreceiving from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \nwould enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. \nThat aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my \nailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where \nwe used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and \nthat was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit \nof the old 'Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we \nconsidered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah \nwho was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir \nwho was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished \nour affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe \nwhereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you \nabuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr?' She said, \"O you there! Didn't you hear what \nhe has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk \n(forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me, \nand after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At \nthat time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) allowed me and I went to my \nparents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \n\"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband \nwho has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! \nDid the people really talk about that?\" \nThat night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, \nand morning broke while I was still weeping, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin \nZaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. \nUsama bin Zaid told Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his \naffection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! She is your wife, and we do not know anything \nabout her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah does not impose \nrestrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, \nshe will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did \nyou ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By \nAllah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would \nblame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of \nher family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" \nSo Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge \non `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who \nwill help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing \nexcept good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, \nand he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I \nwill chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we \nwill obey it.\" \nOn that, Sa`d bin 'Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had \nbeen a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah \nthe Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, \nUsaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin 'Ubada, \"You are a liar! \nBy Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So \nthe two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each \nother while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was standing on the pulpit. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) continued quietening them till \nthey became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that \nneither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept \nfor two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would \nburst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission \nto see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allah's \nApostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, \nwas said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I \nhave been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your \ninnocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allah's forgiveness and repent to Him, for \nwhen a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allah's \nApostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop \nthereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \n\"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allah's \nApostle.\" \nShe said, \"I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had \nlittle knowledge of Qur'an, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so \nthat it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am \ninnocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, \nand Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an \nexample except that of Joseph's father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you \nassert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and \nat that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I \nnever thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited \n(forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be \nrecited: but I hoped that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) might have a vision in which Allah would prove my \ninnocence. By Allah, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the \nDivine Inspiration came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . So there overtook him the same hard condition which \nused to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running \ndown, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the \nStatement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was over, and he was \nsmiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" \nMy mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not \nthank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among \nyou. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). \nWhen Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for \nMistah bin Uthatha because of the latter's kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never \nprovide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: \n(continued...) \n(continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \n\"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, \nthose in need, and those who have left their homes for Allah's Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive \n(i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. \nMost Merciful.\" (24.22) \nAbu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the \naid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha \nfurther said: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What \nhave you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining \nfrom telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), it was \nZainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her \n(from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she \nwas destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4750, Book 65, Hadith 272","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What was the practice of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) when choosing which wife to accompany him on a journey?","id":"bukhari-65-272"},{"hadith-eng":"Aisha's mother, When `Aisha was accused, she fell down Unconscious.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4751, Book 65, Hadith 273","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What emotional impact can false accusations have on an individual?","id":"bukhari-65-273"},{"hadith-eng":"I heard `Aisha reciting: \"When you invented a lie (and carry it) on your tongues.\" (24.15)","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4752, Book 65, Hadith 274","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What are the consequences of spreading falsehoods according to Islamic teachings?","id":"bukhari-65-274"},{"hadith-eng":"Ibn `Abbas asked permission to visit Aisha before her death, and at that time she was in a state of \nagony.

He recited Tashah-hud, and after glorifying and praising Allah as He \r\ndeserved, he said, \"To proceed: O people Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a \r\nforged story against my wife. By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her. By Allah, they accused \r\nher of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my \r\nhouse unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me.\" Sa`d bin \r\nMu`adh got up and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) Allow me to chop their heads off\". \r\nThen a man from the Al-Khazraj (Sa`d bin 'Ubada) to whom the mother of (the poet) Hassan bin \r\nThabit was a relative, got up and said (to Sa`d bin Mu`adh), \"You have told a lie! By Allah, if those \r\npersons were from the Aus Tribe, you would not like to chop their heads off.\" It was probable that \r\nsome evil would take place between the Aus and the Khazraj in the mosque, and I was unaware of all \r\nthat. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs (i.e. to relieve myself), and Um \r\nMistah was accompanying me. \r\nOn our return, Um Mistah stumbled and said, \"Let Mistah. be ruined\" I said to her, \"O mother Why do \r\nyou abuse your Son\" On that Um Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said, \r\n\"Let Mistah be ruined\" I said to her, \"Why do you abuse your son?\" She stumbled for the third time \r\nand said, \"Let Mistah be ruined\" whereupon I rebuked her for that. She said, \"By Allah, I do not abuse \r\nhim except because of you.\" I asked her, \"Concerning what of my affairs?\" So she disclosed the whole \r\nstory to me. I said, \"Has this really happened?\" She replied, \"Yes, by Allah.\" I returned to my house, \r\nastonished (and distressed) that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. \r\nThen I became sick (fever) and said to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \"Send me to my father's house.\" So he sent a \r\nslave with me, and when I entered the house, I found Um Rum-an (my mother) downstairs while (my \r\nfather) Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked, \"What has brought you, O (my) \r\ndaughter?\" I informed her and mentioned to her the whole story, but she did not feel it as I did. She \r\nsaid, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has \r\nother wives but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her.\" But she did not feel the news as I \r\ndid. I asked (her), \"Does my father know about it?\" She said, \"yes\" I asked, Does Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \r\nknow about it too?\" She said, \"Yes, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) does too.\" So the tears filled my eyes and I wept. \r\nAbu Bakr, who was reading upstairs heard my voice and came down and asked my mother, \"What is \r\nthe matter with her? \" She said, \"She has heard what has been said about her (as regards the story of \r\nAl-lfk).\" On that Abu- Bakr wept and said, \"I beseech you by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to \r\nyour home\". \r\nI went back to my home and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had come to my house and asked my maid-servant about \r\nme (my character). The maid-servant said, \"By Allah, I do not know of any defect in her character \r\nexcept that she sleeps and let the sheep enter (her house) and eat her dough.\" On that, some of the \r\nProphet's companions spoke harshly to her and said, \"Tell the truth to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" Finally they \r\ntold her of the affair (of the slander). She said, \"Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her \r\nexcept what goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold.\" Then this news reached the man who was \r\naccused, and he said, \"Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any \r\nwoman.\" Later that man was martyred in Allah's Cause. \r\nNext morning my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me till Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to \r\nme after he had offered the `Asr prayer. He came to me while my parents were sitting around me on \r\nmy right and my left. He praised and glorified Allah and said, \"Now then O `Aisha! If you have \r\ncommitted a bad deed or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah as Allah accepts the \r\nrepentance from his slaves.\" An Al-Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said (to \r\nthe Prophet). \"Isn't it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? Allah's \r\nApostle then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to answer him (on my \r\nbehalf). My father said, \"What should I say?\" Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer \r\nhim. She said, \"What should I say?\" When my parents did not give a reply to the Prophet, I said, \"I \r\ntestify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle!\" \r\nAnd after praising and glorifying Allah as He deserves, I said, \"Now then, by Allah, if I were to tell \r\nyou that I have not done (this evil action) and Allah is a witness that I am telling the truth, that would \r\nnot be of any use to me on your part because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have \r\nabsorbed it; and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin and Allah knows that I have not done it, \r\nthen you will say, 'She has confessed herself guilty.\" By Allah, 'I do not see a suitable example for me \r\nand you but the example of (I tried to remember Jacob's name but couldn't) Joseph's father when he \r\nsaid; So (for me) \"Patience is most fitting against that which you assert. It is Allah (alone) whose help \r\ncan be sought.' \r\nAt that very hour the Divine Inspiration came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and we remained silent. Then the \r\nInspiration was over and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was removing (the \r\nsweat) from his forehead and saying, \"Have the good tidings O ' \"Aisha! Allah has revealed your \r\ninnocence.\" At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me. \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \r\n\"By Allah, I will not do it and will not thank him nor thank either of you, but I will thank Allah Who \r\nhas revealed my innocence. You have heard this story but neither did not deny it nor change it (to \r\ndefend me),\" (Aisha used to say:) \"But as regards Zainab bint Jahsh, (the Prophet's wife), Allah \r\nprotected her because of her piety, so she did not say anything except good (about me), but her sister, \r\nHamna, was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were \r\nMistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite, `Abdullah bin Ubai, who used to spread that news and \r\ntempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamna who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took \r\nan oath that he would never do any favor to Mistah at all. Then Allah revealed the Divine Verse: \r\n\"Let not those among you who are good and wealthy (i.e. Abu Bakr) swear not to give (any sort of \r\nhelp) to their kinsmen, and those in need, (i.e. Mistah) ...Do you not love that Allah should forgive \r\nyou? And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) \r\nOn that, Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, O our Lord! We wish that You should forgive us.\" So Abu \r\nBakr again started giving to Mistah the expenditure which he used to give him before.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4757, Book 65, Hadith 279","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What lessons can be learned about handling accusations and slander in a community?","id":"bukhari-65-279"},{"hadith-eng":"May Allah bestow His Mercy on the early\nemigrant women.

Heraclius said, 'Is there anyone from the people of this man who claims to be a \nprophet?' The people replied, 'Yes.' So I along with some of Quraishi men were called and we entered \nupon Heraclius, and we were seated in front of him. Then he said, 'Who amongst you is the nearest \nrelative to the man who claims to be a prophet?' So they made me sit in front of him and made my \ncompanions sit behind me. \nThen he called upon his translator and said (to him). 'Tell them ( i.e. Abu Sufyan's companions) that I \nam going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyan) regarding that man who claims to be a prophet. So, if he tell me \na lie, they should contradict him (instantly).' By Allah, had I not been afraid that my companions \nwould consider me a liar, I would have told lies. \nHeraclius then said to his translator, 'Ask him: What is his (i.e. the Prophet's) family status amongst \nyou? I said, 'He belongs to a noble family amongst us.\" \nHeraclius said, 'Was any of his ancestors a king?' I said, 'No.' \nHe said, 'Did you ever accuse him of telling lies before his saying what he has said?' I said, 'No.' \nHe said, 'Do the nobles follow him or the poor people?' I said, 'It is the poor who followed him.' \nHe said, 'Is the number of his follower increasing or decreasing?' I said, 'The are increasing.' \nHe said, 'Does anyone renounce his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it?' I \nsaid, 'No.' \nHe said, 'Did you fight with him?' I replied, 'Yes.' \nHe said, 'How was your fighting with him?' I said, 'The fighting between us was undecided and \nvictory was shared by him and us by turns. He inflicts casualties upon us and we inflict casualties \nupon him.' \nHe said, 'Did he ever betray?' I said, 'No, but now we are away from him in this truce and we do not \nknow what he will do in it\" Abu Sufyan added, \"By Allah, I was not able to insert in my speech a \nword (against him) except that. \nHeraclius said, 'Did anybody else (amongst you) ever claimed the same (i.e. Islam) before him? I said, \n'No.' \nThen Heraclius told his translator to tell me (i.e. Abu Sufyan), \n'I asked you about his family status amongst you, and you told me that he comes from a noble family \namongst you Verily, all Apostles come from the noblest family among their people. \nThen I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king, and you denied that. Thereupon I thought \nthat had one of his fore-fathers been a king, I would have said that he (i.e. Muhammad) was seeking to \nrule the kingdom of his fore-fathers. \nThen I asked you regarding his followers, whether they were the noble or the poor among the people, \nand you said that they were only the poor (who follow him). In fact, such are the followers of the \nApostles. \nThen I asked you whether you have ever accused him of telling lies before saying what he said, and \nyour reply was in the negative. Therefore, I took for granted that a man who did not tell a lie about \nothers, could ever tell a lie about Allah. \nThen I asked you whether anyone of his followers had renounced his religion (i.e. Islam) after \nembracing it, being displeased with it, and you denied that. And such is Faith when it mixes with the \ncheerfulness of the hearts. \nThen I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You claimed that they were \nincreasing. That is the way of true faith till it is complete. \nThen I asked you whether you had ever fought with him, and you claimed that you had fought with \nhim and the battle between you and him was undecided and the victory was shared by you and him in \nturns; he inflicted casual ties upon you and you inflicted casualties upon them. Such is the case with \nthe Apostles; they are out to test and the final victory is for them. \nThen I asked you whether he had ever betrayed; you claimed that he had never betrayed. I need, \nApostles never betray. \nThen I asked you whether anyone had said this statement before him; and you denied that.

If I were \ncertain that I can reach him, I would like to meet him and if I were with him, I would wash his feet; \nand his kingdom will expand (surely to what is under my feet.' Then Heraclius asked for the letter of \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) and read it wherein was written: \n\"In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. This letter is) from Muhammad, \nApostle of Allah, to Heraclius, the sovereign of Byzantine........ Peace be upon him who follows the \nRight Path. Now then, I call you to embrace Islam.

(3.64) \nWhen he finished reading the letter, voices grew louder near him and there was a great hue and cry, \nand we were ordered to go out.\" Abu Sufyan added, \"While coming out, I said to my companions, \n'The situation of Ibn Abu Kabsha (i.e. Muhammad) has become strong; even the king of Banu Al14 \nAsfar is afraid of him.'

(Immediately after hearing \nthat), they rushed towards the gate like onagers, but they found them closed. Heraclius then said, \n'Bring them back to me.' So he called them and said, 'I just wanted to test the strength of your \nadherence to your religion. Now I have observed of you that which I like.'

Verily, I have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a \r\nknowledge which I ought not learn.' At that time a bird took with its beak (some water) from the sea: \r\nAl-Khadir then said, 'By Allah, my knowledge and your knowledge besides Allah's Knowledge is like \r\nwhat this bird has taken with its beak from the sea.' Until, when they went on board the boat (18.71). \r\nThey found a small boat which used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other sea-side.

(Sufyan, a sub-narrator said that somebody other than `Amr said) 'At the \nrock there was a water spring called 'Al-Hayat' and none came in touch with its water but became \nalive. So some of the water of that spring fell over that fish, so it moved and slipped out of the basket \nand entered the sea. When Moses woke up, he asked his attendant, 'Bring our early meal' (18.62). \nThe narrator added: Moses did not suffer from fatigue except after he had passed the place he had \nbeen ordered to observe. His attendant Yusha` bin Noon said to him, 'Do you remember (what \nhappened) when we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget (about) the fish ...' (18.63) The \nnarrator added: So they came back, retracing their steps and then they found in the sea, the way of the \nfish looking like a tunnel. So there was an astonishing event for his attendant, and there was tunnel for \nthe fish. When they reached the rock, they found a man covered with a garment. Moses greeted him. \nThe man said astonishingly, 'Is there any such greeting in your land?' Moses said, 'I am Moses.' The \nman said, 'Moses of Bani Israel?' Moses said, 'Yes,' and added, 'may I follow you so that you teach me \nsomething of the Knowledge which you have been taught?' (18.66). Al-Khadir said to him, 'O Moses! \nYou have something of Allah's knowledge which Allah has taught you and which I do not know; and I \nhave something of Allah's knowledge which Allah has taught me and which you do not know.' Moses \nsaid, 'But I will follow you.' Al-Khadir said, 'Then if you follow me, ask me no question about \nanything until I myself speak to you concerning it.' (18.70). After that both of them proceeded along \nthe seashore. There passed by them a boat whose crew recognized Al-Khadir and received them on \nboard free of charge. So they both got on board. A sparrow came and sat on the edge of the boat and \ndipped its beak unto the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses. 'My knowledge and your knowledge and all the \ncreation's knowledge compared to Allah's knowledge is not more than the water taken by this \nsparrow's beak.' \nThen Moses was startled by Al-Khadir's action of taking an adze and scuttling the boat with it. Moses \nsaid to him, 'These people gave us a free lift, but you intentionally scuttled their boat so as to drown \nthem. Surely you have...' (18.71) Then they both proceeded and found a boy playing with other \nboys. Al-Khadir took hold of him by the head and cut it off. Moses said to him, 'Have you killed an \ninnocent soul who has killed nobody? Surely you have done an illegal thing! ' (18.74) He said, \n\"Didn't I tell you that you will not be able to have patient with me up to ..but they refused to entertain \nthem as their guests. There they found a wall therein at the point of collapsing.' (18.75-77) Al-Khadir \nmoved his hand thus and set it upright (repaired it). Moses said to him, 'When we entered this town, \nthey neither gave us hospitality nor fed us; if you had wished, you could have taken wages for it,' Al- \nKhadir said, 'This is the parting between you and me I will tell you the interpretation of (those things) \nabout which you were unable to hold patience.'...(18.78) \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, 'We wished that Moses could have been more patient so that He (Allah) could \nhave described to us more about their story.' Ibn `Abbas used to recite:-- 'And in front (ahead) of them \nthere was a king who used to seize every (serviceable) boat by force.

Once he drew lots \nwhen he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allah's \nApostle after Allah's order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my \nhowdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allah's \nApostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered to \nproceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked \non till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my \nhowdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I \nlooked for it and my search for it detained me. \nThe group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel \non which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and \nwere not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the \nhowdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. \nThen I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I \nwent to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. \nWhile I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Mu'attil As-Sulami Adh- \nDhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing \nplace in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on \nseeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna \nilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, \nhe did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel \nkneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading \nthe she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot \nmidday. \nThen whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged \nstatement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one \nmonth while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not \naware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer \nreceiving from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \nwould enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. \nThat aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my \nailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where \nwe used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and \nthat was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit \nof the old 'Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we \nconsidered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah \nwho was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir \nwho was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished \nour affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe \nwhereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you \nabuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr?' She said, \"O you there! Didn't you hear what \nhe has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk \n(forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me, \nand after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At \nthat time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) allowed me and I went to my \nparents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \n\"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband \nwho has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! \nDid the people really talk about that?\" \nThat night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, \nand morning broke while I was still weeping, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin \nZaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. \nUsama bin Zaid told Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his \naffection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! She is your wife, and we do not know anything \nabout her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah does not impose \nrestrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, \nshe will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did \nyou ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By \nAllah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would \nblame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of \nher family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" \nSo Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge \non `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who \nwill help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing \nexcept good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, \nand he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I \nwill chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we \nwill obey it.\" \nOn that, Sa`d bin 'Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had \nbeen a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah \nthe Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, \nUsaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin 'Ubada, \"You are a liar! \nBy Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So \nthe two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each \nother while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was standing on the pulpit. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) continued quietening them till \nthey became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that \nneither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept \nfor two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would \nburst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission \nto see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allah's \nApostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, \nwas said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I \nhave been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your \ninnocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allah's forgiveness and repent to Him, for \nwhen a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allah's \nApostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop \nthereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \n\"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allah's \nApostle.\" \nShe said, \"I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had \nlittle knowledge of Qur'an, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so \nthat it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am \ninnocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, \nand Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an \nexample except that of Joseph's father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you \nassert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and \nat that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I \nnever thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited \n(forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be \nrecited: but I hoped that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) might have a vision in which Allah would prove my \ninnocence. By Allah, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the \nDivine Inspiration came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . So there overtook him the same hard condition which \nused to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running \ndown, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the \nStatement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was over, and he was \nsmiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" \nMy mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not \nthank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among \nyou. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). \nWhen Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for \nMistah bin Uthatha because of the latter's kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never \nprovide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: \n(continued...) \n(continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \n\"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, \nthose in need, and those who have left their homes for Allah's Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive \n(i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. \nMost Merciful.\" (24.22) \nAbu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the \naid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha \nfurther said: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What \nhave you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining \nfrom telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), it was \nZainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her \n(from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she \nwas destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4750, Book 65, Hadith 272","grade":"","question #":"question #2","question":"How did the incident of the lost necklace lead to the spread of false accusations against Aisha?","id":"bukhari-65-770"},{"hadith-eng":"Aisha's mother, When `Aisha was accused, she fell down Unconscious.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4751, Book 65, Hadith 273","grade":"","question #":"question #2","question":"How did the family of Aisha react to the accusations against her?","id":"bukhari-65-771"},{"hadith-eng":"I heard `Aisha reciting: \"When you invented a lie (and carry it) on your tongues.\" (24.15)","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4752, Book 65, Hadith 274","grade":"","question #":"question #2","question":"How does the Quran address the issue of lying and fabricating false statements?","id":"bukhari-65-772"},{"hadith-eng":"Ibn `Abbas asked permission to visit Aisha before her death, and at that time she was in a state of \nagony.

By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her. By Allah, they accused \r\nher of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my \r\nhouse unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me.\" Sa`d bin \r\nMu`adh got up and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) Allow me to chop their heads off\". \r\nThen a man from the Al-Khazraj (Sa`d bin 'Ubada) to whom the mother of (the poet) Hassan bin \r\nThabit was a relative, got up and said (to Sa`d bin Mu`adh), \"You have told a lie! By Allah, if those \r\npersons were from the Aus Tribe, you would not like to chop their heads off.\" It was probable that \r\nsome evil would take place between the Aus and the Khazraj in the mosque, and I was unaware of all \r\nthat. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs (i.e. to relieve myself), and Um \r\nMistah was accompanying me. \r\nOn our return, Um Mistah stumbled and said, \"Let Mistah. be ruined\" I said to her, \"O mother Why do \r\nyou abuse your Son\" On that Um Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said, \r\n\"Let Mistah be ruined\" I said to her, \"Why do you abuse your son?\" She stumbled for the third time \r\nand said, \"Let Mistah be ruined\" whereupon I rebuked her for that. She said, \"By Allah, I do not abuse \r\nhim except because of you.\" I asked her, \"Concerning what of my affairs?\" So she disclosed the whole \r\nstory to me. I said, \"Has this really happened?\" She replied, \"Yes, by Allah.\" I returned to my house, \r\nastonished (and distressed) that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. \r\nThen I became sick (fever) and said to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \"Send me to my father's house.\" So he sent a \r\nslave with me, and when I entered the house, I found Um Rum-an (my mother) downstairs while (my \r\nfather) Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked, \"What has brought you, O (my) \r\ndaughter?\" I informed her and mentioned to her the whole story, but she did not feel it as I did. She \r\nsaid, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has \r\nother wives but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her.\" But she did not feel the news as I \r\ndid. I asked (her), \"Does my father know about it?\" She said, \"yes\" I asked, Does Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \r\nknow about it too?\" She said, \"Yes, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) does too.\" So the tears filled my eyes and I wept. \r\nAbu Bakr, who was reading upstairs heard my voice and came down and asked my mother, \"What is \r\nthe matter with her? \" She said, \"She has heard what has been said about her (as regards the story of \r\nAl-lfk).\" On that Abu- Bakr wept and said, \"I beseech you by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to \r\nyour home\". \r\nI went back to my home and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had come to my house and asked my maid-servant about \r\nme (my character). The maid-servant said, \"By Allah, I do not know of any defect in her character \r\nexcept that she sleeps and let the sheep enter (her house) and eat her dough.\" On that, some of the \r\nProphet's companions spoke harshly to her and said, \"Tell the truth to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" Finally they \r\ntold her of the affair (of the slander). She said, \"Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her \r\nexcept what goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold.\" Then this news reached the man who was \r\naccused, and he said, \"Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any \r\nwoman.\" Later that man was martyred in Allah's Cause. \r\nNext morning my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me till Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to \r\nme after he had offered the `Asr prayer. He came to me while my parents were sitting around me on \r\nmy right and my left. He praised and glorified Allah and said, \"Now then O `Aisha! If you have \r\ncommitted a bad deed or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah as Allah accepts the \r\nrepentance from his slaves.\" An Al-Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said (to \r\nthe Prophet). \"Isn't it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? Allah's \r\nApostle then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to answer him (on my \r\nbehalf). My father said, \"What should I say?\" Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer \r\nhim. She said, \"What should I say?\" When my parents did not give a reply to the Prophet, I said, \"I \r\ntestify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle!\" \r\nAnd after praising and glorifying Allah as He deserves, I said, \"Now then, by Allah, if I were to tell \r\nyou that I have not done (this evil action) and Allah is a witness that I am telling the truth, that would \r\nnot be of any use to me on your part because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have \r\nabsorbed it; and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin and Allah knows that I have not done it, \r\nthen you will say, 'She has confessed herself guilty.\" By Allah, 'I do not see a suitable example for me \r\nand you but the example of (I tried to remember Jacob's name but couldn't) Joseph's father when he \r\nsaid; So (for me) \"Patience is most fitting against that which you assert. It is Allah (alone) whose help \r\ncan be sought.' \r\nAt that very hour the Divine Inspiration came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and we remained silent. Then the \r\nInspiration was over and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was removing (the \r\nsweat) from his forehead and saying, \"Have the good tidings O ' \"Aisha! Allah has revealed your \r\ninnocence.\" At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me. \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \r\n\"By Allah, I will not do it and will not thank him nor thank either of you, but I will thank Allah Who \r\nhas revealed my innocence. You have heard this story but neither did not deny it nor change it (to \r\ndefend me),\" (Aisha used to say:) \"But as regards Zainab bint Jahsh, (the Prophet's wife), Allah \r\nprotected her because of her piety, so she did not say anything except good (about me), but her sister, \r\nHamna, was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were \r\nMistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite, `Abdullah bin Ubai, who used to spread that news and \r\ntempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamna who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took \r\nan oath that he would never do any favor to Mistah at all. Then Allah revealed the Divine Verse: \r\n\"Let not those among you who are good and wealthy (i.e. Abu Bakr) swear not to give (any sort of \r\nhelp) to their kinsmen, and those in need, (i.e. Mistah) ...Do you not love that Allah should forgive \r\nyou? And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) \r\nOn that, Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, O our Lord!

Heraclius said, 'Is there anyone from the people of this man who claims to be a \nprophet?' The people replied, 'Yes.' So I along with some of Quraishi men were called and we entered \nupon Heraclius, and we were seated in front of him. Then he said, 'Who amongst you is the nearest \nrelative to the man who claims to be a prophet?' So they made me sit in front of him and made my \ncompanions sit behind me. \nThen he called upon his translator and said (to him). 'Tell them ( i.e. Abu Sufyan's companions) that I \nam going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyan) regarding that man who claims to be a prophet. So, if he tell me \na lie, they should contradict him (instantly).' By Allah, had I not been afraid that my companions \nwould consider me a liar, I would have told lies. \nHeraclius then said to his translator, 'Ask him: What is his (i.e. the Prophet's) family status amongst \nyou? I said, 'He belongs to a noble family amongst us.\" \nHeraclius said, 'Was any of his ancestors a king?' I said, 'No.' \nHe said, 'Did you ever accuse him of telling lies before his saying what he has said?' I said, 'No.' \nHe said, 'Do the nobles follow him or the poor people?' I said, 'It is the poor who followed him.' \nHe said, 'Is the number of his follower increasing or decreasing?' I said, 'The are increasing.' \nHe said, 'Does anyone renounce his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it?' I \nsaid, 'No.' \nHe said, 'Did you fight with him?' I replied, 'Yes.' \nHe said, 'How was your fighting with him?' I said, 'The fighting between us was undecided and \nvictory was shared by him and us by turns. He inflicts casualties upon us and we inflict casualties \nupon him.' \nHe said, 'Did he ever betray?' I said, 'No, but now we are away from him in this truce and we do not \nknow what he will do in it\" Abu Sufyan added, \"By Allah, I was not able to insert in my speech a \nword (against him) except that. \nHeraclius said, 'Did anybody else (amongst you) ever claimed the same (i.e. Islam) before him? I said, \n'No.' \nThen Heraclius told his translator to tell me (i.e. Abu Sufyan), \n'I asked you about his family status amongst you, and you told me that he comes from a noble family \namongst you Verily, all Apostles come from the noblest family among their people. \nThen I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king, and you denied that. Thereupon I thought \nthat had one of his fore-fathers been a king, I would have said that he (i.e. Muhammad) was seeking to \nrule the kingdom of his fore-fathers. \nThen I asked you regarding his followers, whether they were the noble or the poor among the people, \nand you said that they were only the poor (who follow him). In fact, such are the followers of the \nApostles. \nThen I asked you whether you have ever accused him of telling lies before saying what he said, and \nyour reply was in the negative. Therefore, I took for granted that a man who did not tell a lie about \nothers, could ever tell a lie about Allah. \nThen I asked you whether anyone of his followers had renounced his religion (i.e. Islam) after \nembracing it, being displeased with it, and you denied that. And such is Faith when it mixes with the \ncheerfulness of the hearts. \nThen I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You claimed that they were \nincreasing. That is the way of true faith till it is complete. \nThen I asked you whether you had ever fought with him, and you claimed that you had fought with \nhim and the battle between you and him was undecided and the victory was shared by you and him in \nturns; he inflicted casual ties upon you and you inflicted casualties upon them. Such is the case with \nthe Apostles; they are out to test and the final victory is for them. \nThen I asked you whether he had ever betrayed; you claimed that he had never betrayed. I need, \nApostles never betray. \nThen I asked you whether anyone had said this statement before him; and you denied that.

I said, 'He orders us (to \noffer) prayers and (to pay) Zakat and to keep good relationship with the Kith and kin and to be chaste.' \nThen Heraclius said, 'If whatever you have said, is true, he is really a prophet, and I knew that he ( i.e. \nthe Prophet (ﷺ) ) was going to appear, but I never thought that he would be from amongst you. If I were \ncertain that I can reach him, I would like to meet him and if I were with him, I would wash his feet; \nand his kingdom will expand (surely to what is under my feet.' Then Heraclius asked for the letter of \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) and read it wherein was written: \n\"In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.

Verily, I have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a \r\nknowledge which I ought not learn.' At that time a bird took with its beak (some water) from the sea: \r\nAl-Khadir then said, 'By Allah, my knowledge and your knowledge besides Allah's Knowledge is like \r\nwhat this bird has taken with its beak from the sea.' Until, when they went on board the boat (18.71). \r\nThey found a small boat which used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other sea-side. The \r\ncrew recognized Al-Khadir and said, 'The pious slave of Allah.' (We said to Sa`id \"Was that Khadir?\" \r\nHe said, \"Yes.\") The boat men said, 'We will not get him on board with fare.'

Once he drew lots \nwhen he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allah's \nApostle after Allah's order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my \nhowdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allah's \nApostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) ordered to \nproceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked \non till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my \nhowdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I \nlooked for it and my search for it detained me. \nThe group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel \non which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and \nwere not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the \nhowdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. \nThen I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I \nwent to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. \nWhile I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Mu'attil As-Sulami Adh- \nDhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing \nplace in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on \nseeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna \nilaihi rajiun,\" which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, \nhe did not say to me a single word except, \"Inna Li l-lahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,\" till he made his shecamel \nkneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading \nthe she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot \nmidday. \nThen whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged \nstatement) was `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one \nmonth while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not \naware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer \nreceiving from Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \nwould enter upon me, say a greeting and add, \"How is that (lady)?\" and then depart. \nThat aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my \nailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where \nwe used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and \nthat was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit \nof the old 'Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we \nconsidered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah \nwho was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin `Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir \nwho was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished \nour affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe \nwhereupon she said, \"Let Mistah be ruined ! \" I said to her, \"What a bad word you have said! Do you \nabuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr?' She said, \"O you there! Didn't you hear what \nhe has said?\" I said, \"And what did he say?\" She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk \n(forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to me, \nand after greeting, he said, \"How is that (lady)?\" I said, \"Will you allow me to go to my parents?\" At \nthat time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) allowed me and I went to my \nparents and asked my mother, \"O my mother! What are the people talking about?\" My mother said, \n\"O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband \nwho has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.\" I said, \"Subhan Allah! \nDid the people really talk about that?\" \nThat night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, \nand morning broke while I was still weeping, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called `Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin \nZaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. \nUsama bin Zaid told Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his \naffection he kept for her. He said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! She is your wife, and we do not know anything \nabout her except good.\" But `Ali bin Abi Talib said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! Allah does not impose \nrestrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, \nshe will tell you the truth.\" `Aisha added: So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) called for Barira and said, \"O Barira! Did \nyou ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, \"By \nAllah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would \nblame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of \nher family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.\" \nSo Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge \non `Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), while on the pulpit, said, \"O Muslims! Who \nwill help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing \nexcept good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, \nand he never used to visit my family except with me,\" Sa`d bin Mu`adh Al-Ansari got up and said, \"O \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ)! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I \nwill chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we \nwill obey it.\" \nOn that, Sa`d bin 'Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had \nbeen a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sa`d (bin Mu`adh), \"By Allah \nthe Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!\" On that, \nUsaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sa`d (bin Mu`adh) got up and said to Sa`d bin 'Ubada, \"You are a liar! \nBy Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!\" So \nthe two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each \nother while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was standing on the pulpit. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) continued quietening them till \nthey became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that \nneither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept \nfor two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would \nburst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission \nto see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allah's \nApostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, \nwas said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, \"Thereafter, O `Aisha! I \nhave been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your \ninnocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allah's forgiveness and repent to Him, for \nwhen a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.\" When Allah's \nApostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop \nthereof. Then I said to my father, \"Reply to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on my behalf as to what he said.\" He said, \n\"By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" Then I said to my mother, \"Reply to Allah's \nApostle.\" \nShe said, \"I do not know what to say to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" Still a young girl as I was and though I had \nlittle knowledge of Qur'an, I said, \"By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so \nthat it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am \ninnocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, \nand Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an \nexample except that of Joseph's father: \"So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you \nassert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and \nat that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I \nnever thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited \n(forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be \nrecited: but I hoped that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) might have a vision in which Allah would prove my \ninnocence. By Allah, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the \nDivine Inspiration came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) . So there overtook him the same hard condition which \nused to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running \ndown, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the \nStatement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was over, and he was \nsmiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, \"Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.\" \nMy mother said to me, \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \"By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not \nthank anybody but Allah.\" So Allah revealed: \"Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among \nyou. Think it not....\" (24.11-20). \nWhen Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for \nMistah bin Uthatha because of the latter's kinship to him and his poverty, said, \"By Allah, I will never \nprovide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha\". So Allah revealed: \n(continued...) \n(continuing... 1): -6.274:... ... \n\"Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, \nthose in need, and those who have left their homes for Allah's Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive \n(i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. \nMost Merciful.\" (24.22) \nAbu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.\" So he resumed giving Mistah the \naid he used to give him before and said, \"By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.\" Aisha \nfurther said: Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, \"O Zainab! What \nhave you seen?\" She replied, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining \nfrom telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).\" Of all the wives of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ), it was \nZainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her \n(from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she \nwas destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4750, Book 65, Hadith 272","grade":"","question #":"question #3","question":"What role did divine revelation play in resolving the slander against Aisha?","id":"bukhari-65-1269"},{"hadith-eng":"Aisha's mother, When `Aisha was accused, she fell down Unconscious.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4751, Book 65, Hadith 273","grade":"","question #":"question #3","question":"What are the challenges faced by individuals when dealing with slander or false accusations?","id":"bukhari-65-1270"},{"hadith-eng":"I heard `Aisha reciting: \"When you invented a lie (and carry it) on your tongues.\" (24.15)","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4752, Book 65, Hadith 274","grade":"","question #":"question #3","question":"What lessons can be learned from the recitation of Quranic verses about falsehood by Aisha?","id":"bukhari-65-1271"},{"hadith-eng":"Ibn `Abbas asked permission to visit Aisha before her death, and at that time she was in a state of \nagony.

He recited Tashah-hud, and after glorifying and praising Allah as He \r\ndeserved, he said, \"To proceed: O people Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a \r\nforged story against my wife. By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her. By Allah, they accused \r\nher of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my \r\nhouse unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me.\" Sa`d bin \r\nMu`adh got up and said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) Allow me to chop their heads off\". \r\nThen a man from the Al-Khazraj (Sa`d bin 'Ubada) to whom the mother of (the poet) Hassan bin \r\nThabit was a relative, got up and said (to Sa`d bin Mu`adh), \"You have told a lie! By Allah, if those \r\npersons were from the Aus Tribe, you would not like to chop their heads off.\" It was probable that \r\nsome evil would take place between the Aus and the Khazraj in the mosque, and I was unaware of all \r\nthat. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs (i.e. to relieve myself), and Um \r\nMistah was accompanying me. \r\nOn our return, Um Mistah stumbled and said, \"Let Mistah. be ruined\" I said to her, \"O mother Why do \r\nyou abuse your Son\" On that Um Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said, \r\n\"Let Mistah be ruined\" I said to her, \"Why do you abuse your son?\" She stumbled for the third time \r\nand said, \"Let Mistah be ruined\" whereupon I rebuked her for that. She said, \"By Allah, I do not abuse \r\nhim except because of you.\" I asked her, \"Concerning what of my affairs?\" So she disclosed the whole \r\nstory to me. I said, \"Has this really happened?\" She replied, \"Yes, by Allah.\" I returned to my house, \r\nastonished (and distressed) that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. \r\nThen I became sick (fever) and said to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \"Send me to my father's house.\" So he sent a \r\nslave with me, and when I entered the house, I found Um Rum-an (my mother) downstairs while (my \r\nfather) Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked, \"What has brought you, O (my) \r\ndaughter?\" I informed her and mentioned to her the whole story, but she did not feel it as I did. She \r\nsaid, \"O my daughter! Take it easy, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has \r\nother wives but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her.\" But she did not feel the news as I \r\ndid. I asked (her), \"Does my father know about it?\" She said, \"yes\" I asked, Does Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \r\nknow about it too?\" She said, \"Yes, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) does too.\" So the tears filled my eyes and I wept. \r\nAbu Bakr, who was reading upstairs heard my voice and came down and asked my mother, \"What is \r\nthe matter with her? \" She said, \"She has heard what has been said about her (as regards the story of \r\nAl-lfk).\" On that Abu- Bakr wept and said, \"I beseech you by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to \r\nyour home\". \r\nI went back to my home and Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had come to my house and asked my maid-servant about \r\nme (my character). The maid-servant said, \"By Allah, I do not know of any defect in her character \r\nexcept that she sleeps and let the sheep enter (her house) and eat her dough.\" On that, some of the \r\nProphet's companions spoke harshly to her and said, \"Tell the truth to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ).\" Finally they \r\ntold her of the affair (of the slander). She said, \"Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her \r\nexcept what goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold.\" Then this news reached the man who was \r\naccused, and he said, \"Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any \r\nwoman.\" Later that man was martyred in Allah's Cause. \r\nNext morning my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me till Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came to \r\nme after he had offered the `Asr prayer. He came to me while my parents were sitting around me on \r\nmy right and my left. He praised and glorified Allah and said, \"Now then O `Aisha! If you have \r\ncommitted a bad deed or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah as Allah accepts the \r\nrepentance from his slaves.\" An Al-Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said (to \r\nthe Prophet). \"Isn't it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? Allah's \r\nApostle then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to answer him (on my \r\nbehalf). My father said, \"What should I say?\" Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer \r\nhim. She said, \"What should I say?\" When my parents did not give a reply to the Prophet, I said, \"I \r\ntestify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle!\" \r\nAnd after praising and glorifying Allah as He deserves, I said, \"Now then, by Allah, if I were to tell \r\nyou that I have not done (this evil action) and Allah is a witness that I am telling the truth, that would \r\nnot be of any use to me on your part because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have \r\nabsorbed it; and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin and Allah knows that I have not done it, \r\nthen you will say, 'She has confessed herself guilty.\" By Allah, 'I do not see a suitable example for me \r\nand you but the example of (I tried to remember Jacob's name but couldn't) Joseph's father when he \r\nsaid; So (for me) \"Patience is most fitting against that which you assert. It is Allah (alone) whose help \r\ncan be sought.' \r\nAt that very hour the Divine Inspiration came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and we remained silent. Then the \r\nInspiration was over and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was removing (the \r\nsweat) from his forehead and saying, \"Have the good tidings O ' \"Aisha! Allah has revealed your \r\ninnocence.\" At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me. \"Get up and go to him.\" I said, \r\n\"By Allah, I will not do it and will not thank him nor thank either of you, but I will thank Allah Who \r\nhas revealed my innocence. You have heard this story but neither did not deny it nor change it (to \r\ndefend me),\" (Aisha used to say:) \"But as regards Zainab bint Jahsh, (the Prophet's wife), Allah \r\nprotected her because of her piety, so she did not say anything except good (about me), but her sister, \r\nHamna, was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were \r\nMistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite, `Abdullah bin Ubai, who used to spread that news and \r\ntempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamna who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took \r\nan oath that he would never do any favor to Mistah at all. Then Allah revealed the Divine Verse: \r\n\"Let not those among you who are good and wealthy (i.e. Abu Bakr) swear not to give (any sort of \r\nhelp) to their kinsmen, and those in need, (i.e. Mistah) ...Do you not love that Allah should forgive \r\nyou? And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.\" (24.22) \r\nOn that, Abu Bakr said, \"Yes, by Allah, O our Lord! We wish that You should forgive us.\" So Abu \r\nBakr again started giving to Mistah the expenditure which he used to give him before.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 4757, Book 65, Hadith 279","grade":"","question #":"question #3","question":"What role does divine revelation play in resolving disputes and clarifying truths in Islamic tradition?","id":"bukhari-65-1276"},{"hadith-eng":"May Allah bestow His Mercy on the early\nemigrant women.

(38.86) Now I will tell you about Ad- \nDukhan (the smoke), Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) invited the Quraish to embrace Islam, but they delayed their \nresponse. So he said, \"O Allah! Help me against them by sending on them seven years of famine \nsimilar to the seven years of famine of Joseph.\" So the famine year overtook them and everything was \ndestroyed till they ate dead animals and skins. People started imagining to see smoke between them \nand the sky because of severe hunger. Allah said: \n'Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible, covering the \npeople. . . This is painful torment.' (44.10-11) (So they invoked Allah) \"Our Lord! Remove the \npunishment from us really we are believers.\" How can there be an (effectual) reminder for them when \nan Apostle, explaining things clearly, has already come to them? Then they had turned away from him \nand said: 'One taught (by a human being), a madman?' 'We shall indeed remove punishment for a \nwhile, but truly, you will revert (to disbelief).' (44.12-15) Will the punishment be removed on the Day \nof Resurrection?\" `Abdullah added, \"The punishment was removed from them for a while but they \nreverted to disbelief, so Allah destroyed them on the Day of Badr.
