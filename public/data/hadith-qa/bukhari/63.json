So I greeted him and he returned the \ngreeting to me and said, 'You are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended \nwith me till we reached the second heaven. Gabriel asked for the gate to be opened. It was asked, \n'Who is it?' Gabriel answered, 'Gabriel.' It was asked, 'Who is accompanying you?' Gabriel replied, \n'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel answered in the affirmative. Then it was \nsaid, 'He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!' The gate was opened. \nWhen I went over the second heaven, there I saw Yahya (i.e. John) and `Isa (i.e. Jesus) who were \ncousins of each other. Gabriel said (to me), 'These are John and Jesus; pay them your greetings.' So I \ngreeted them and both of them returned my greetings to me and said, 'You are welcomed, O pious \nbrother and pious Prophet.' Then Gabriel ascended with me to the third heaven and asked for its gate \nto be opened. It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel replied, 'Gabriel.' It was asked, 'Who is accompanying \nyou?' Gabriel replied, 'Muhammad.' It was asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel replied in the \naffirmative. Then it was said, 'He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is!'

So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, 'You are welcomed, O \npious brother and pious Prophet.' When I left him (i.e. Moses) he wept. Someone asked him, 'What \nmakes you weep?' Moses said, 'I weep because after me there has been sent (as Prophet) a young man \nwhose followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers.' Then Gabriel ascended \nwith me to the seventh heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel \nreplied, 'Gabriel.' It was asked,' Who is accompanying you?'

Gabriel said (to me), 'This is your \nfather; pay your greetings to him.' So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, 'You \nare welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.' Then I was made to ascend to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. \nthe Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) Behold! Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr (i.e. a place near \nMedina) and its leaves were as big as the ears of elephants. Gabriel said, 'This is the Lote Tree of the \nutmost boundary) . Behold ! There ran four rivers, two were hidden and two were visible, I asked, \n'What are these two kinds of rivers, O Gabriel?' He replied,' As for the hidden rivers, they are two \nrivers in Paradise and the visible rivers are the Nile and the Euphrates.' \nThen Al-Bait-ul-Ma'mur (i.e. the Sacred House) was shown to me and a container full of wine and \nanother full of milk and a third full of honey were brought to me. I took the milk. Gabriel remarked, \n'This is the Islamic religion which you and your followers are following.' Then the prayers were \nenjoined on me: They were fifty prayers a day. When I returned, I passed by Moses who asked (me), \n'What have you been ordered to do?' I replied, 'I have been ordered to offer fifty prayers a day.' Moses \nsaid, 'Your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day, and by Allah, I have tested people before you, \nand I have tried my level best with Bani Israel (in vain). Go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to \nlessen your followers' burden.' So I went back, and Allah reduced ten prayers for me. Then again I \ncame to Moses, but he repeated the same as he had said before. Then again I went back to Allah and \nHe reduced ten more prayers. When I came back to Moses he said the same, I went back to Allah and \nHe ordered me to observe ten prayers a day. When I came back to Moses, he repeated the same \nadvice, so I went back to Allah and was ordered to observe five prayers a day. \nWhen I came back to Moses, he said, 'What have you been ordered?' I replied, 'I have been ordered to \nobserve five prayers a day.' He said, 'Your followers cannot bear five prayers a day, and no doubt, I \nhave got an experience of the people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel, so go \nback to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your follower's burden.' I said, 'I have requested so \nmuch of my Lord that I feel ashamed, but I am satisfied now and surrender to Allah's Order.' When I \nleft, I heard a voice saying, 'I have passed My Order and have lessened the burden of My Worshipers.\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 3887, Book 63, Hadith 112","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What is the significance of the Night Journey and Ascension in Islamic tradition?","id":"bukhari-63-112"},{"hadith-eng":"Regarding the Statement of Allah\" \n\"And We granted the vision (Ascension to the heavens) which We made you see (as an actual eye \nwitness) was only made as a trial for the people.\" (17.60) \nIbn `Abbas added: The sights which Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) was shown on the Night Journey when he was \ntaken to Bait-ulMaqdis (i.e. Jerusalem) were actual sights, (not dreams).

When the Muslims were put to test (i.e. troubled by the pagans), Abu Bakr set out migrating to the land of Ethiopia, and when he reached Bark-al-Ghimad, Ibn Ad-Daghina, the chief of the tribe of Qara, met him and said, \"O Abu Bakr! Where are you going?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"My people have turned me out (of my country), so I want to wander on the earth and worship my Lord.\" Ibn Ad-Daghina said, \"O Abu Bakr! A man like you should not leave his home-land, nor should he be driven out, because you help the destitute, earn their livings, and you keep good relations with your Kith and kin, help the weak and poor, entertain guests generously, and help the calamity-stricken persons. Therefore I am your protector. Go back and worship your Lord in your town.\"So Abu Bakr returned and Ibn Ad-Daghina accompanied him. In the evening Ibn Ad-Daghina visited the nobles of Quraish and said to them. \"A man like Abu Bakr should not leave his homeland, nor should he be driven out. Do you (i.e. Quraish) drive out a man who helps the destitute, earns their living, keeps good relations with his Kith and kin, helps the weak and poor, entertains guests generously and helps the calamity-stricken persons?\" So the people of Quraish could not refuse Ibn Ad-Daghina's protection, and they said to Ibn Ad-Daghina, \"Let Abu Bakr worship his Lord in his house. He can pray and recite there whatever he likes, but he should not hurt us with it, and should not do it publicly, because we are afraid that he may affect our women and children.\" Ibn Ad-Daghina told Abu Bakr of all that. Abu Bakr stayed in that state, worshipping his Lord in his house. He did not pray publicly, nor did he recite Quran outside his house.Then a thought occurred to Abu Bakr to build a mosque in front of his house, and there he used to pray and recite the Quran. The women and children of the pagans began to gather around him in great number. They used to wonder at him and look at him. Abu Bakr was a man who used to weep too much, and he could not help weeping on reciting the Quran. That situation scared the nobles of the pagans of Quraish, so they sent for Ibn Ad-Daghina. When he came to them, they said, \"We accepted your protection of Abu Bakr on condition that he should worship his Lord in his house, but he has violated the conditions and he has built a mosque in front of his house where he prays and recites the Quran publicly. We are now afraid that he may affect our women and children unfavorably. So, prevent him from that. If he likes to confine the worship of his Lord to his house, he may do so, but if he insists on doing that openly, ask him to release you from your obligation to protect him, for we dislike to break our pact with you, but we deny Abu Bakr the right to announce his act publicly.\" Ibn Ad-Daghina went to Abu- Bakr and said, (\"O Abu Bakr!) You know well what contract I have made on your behalf; now, you are either to abide by it, or else release me from my obligation of protecting you, because I do not want the 'Arabs hear that my people have dishonored a contract I have made on behalf of another man.\" Abu Bakr replied, \"I release you from your pact to protect me, and am pleased with the protection from Allah.\"At that time the Prophet (ﷺ) was in Mecca, and he said to the Muslims, \"In a dream I have been shown your migration place, a land of date palm trees, between two mountains, the two stony tracts.\" So, some people migrated to Medina, and most of those people who had previously migrated to the land of Ethiopia, returned to Medina. Abu Bakr also prepared to leave for Medina, but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him, \"Wait for a while, because I hope that I will be allowed to migrate also.\" Abu Bakr said, \"Do you indeed expect this? Let my father be sacrificed for you!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Yes.\" So Abu Bakr did not migrate for the sake of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in order to accompany him. He fed two she-camels he possessed with the leaves of As-Samur tree that fell on being struck by a stick for four months.One day, while we were sitting in Abu Bakr's house at noon, someone said to Abu Bakr, \"This is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) with his head covered coming at a time at which he never used to visit us before.\" Abu Bakr said, \"May my parents be sacrificed for him. By Allah, he has not come at this hour except for a great necessity.\" So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came and asked permission to enter, and he was allowed to enter. When he entered, he said to Abu Bakr. \"Tell everyone who is present with you to go away.\" Abu Bakr replied, \"There are none but your family. May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"i have been given permission to migrate.\" Abu Bakr said, \"Shall I accompany you? May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Yes.\" Abu Bakr said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! May my father be sacrificed for you, take one of these two she-camels of mine.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, \"(I will accept it) with payment.\" So we prepared the baggage quickly and put some journey food in a leather bag for them. Asma, Abu Bakr's daughter, cut a piece from her waist belt and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it, and for that reason she was named Dhat-un-Nitaqain (i.e. the owner of two belts).Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr reached a cave on the mountain of Thaur and stayed there for three nights. 'Abdullah bin Abi Bakr who was intelligent and a sagacious youth, used to stay (with them) aver night. He used to leave them before day break so that in the morning he would be with Quraish as if he had spent the night in Mecca. He would keep in mind any plot made against them, and when it became dark he would (go and) inform them of it. 'Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr, used to bring the milch sheep (of his master, Abu Bakr) to them a little while after nightfall in order to rest the sheep there. So they always had fresh milk at night, the milk of their sheep, and the milk which they warmed by throwing heated stones in it. 'Amir bin Fuhaira would then call the herd away when it was still dark (before daybreak). He did the same in each of those three nights. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr had hired a man from the tribe of Bani Ad-Dail from the family of Bani Abd bin Adi as an expert guide, and he was in alliance with the family of Al-'As bin Wail As-Sahmi and he was on the religion of the infidels of Quraish. The Prophet (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr trusted him and gave him their two she-camels and took his promise to bring their two she camels to the cave of the mountain of Thaur in the morning after three nights later. And (when they set out), 'Amir bin Fuhaira and the guide went along with them and the guide led them along the sea-shore.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 3905, Book 63, Hadith 130","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What qualities and actions made Abu Bakr a respected and protected figure in his community?","id":"bukhari-63-130"},{"hadith-eng":"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) met Az-Zubair in a caravan of Muslim merchants who were returning from Sham. Az-Zubair provided Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr with white clothes to wear. When the Muslims of Medina heard the news of the departure of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) from Mecca (towards Medina), they started going to the Harra every morning . They would wait for him till the heat of the noon forced them to return. One day, after waiting for a long while, they returned home, and when they went into their houses, a Jew climbed up the roof of one of the forts of his people to look for some thing, and he saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his companions dressed in white clothes, emerging out of the desert mirage.The Jew could not help shouting at the top of his voice, \"O you 'Arabs! Here is your great man whom you have been waiting for!\" So all the Muslims rushed to their arms and received Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on the summit of Harra. The Prophet (ﷺ) turned with them to the right and alighted at the quarters of Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf, and this was on Monday in the month of Rabi-ul-Awal. Abu Bakr stood up, receiving the people while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sat down and kept silent. Some of the Ansar who came and had not seen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) before, began greeting Abu Bakr, but when the sunshine fell on Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr came forward and shaded him with his sheet only then the people came to know Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stayed with Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf for ten nights and established the mosque (mosque of Quba) which was founded on piety. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) prayed in it and then mounted his she-camel and proceeded on, accompanied by the people till his she-camel knelt down at (the place of) the Mosque of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at Medina. Some Muslims used to pray there in those days, and that place was a yard for drying dates belonging to Suhail and Sahl, the orphan boys who were under the guardianship of 'Asad bin Zurara. When his she-camel knelt down, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"This place, Allah willing, will be our abiding place.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then called the two boys and told them to suggest a price for that yard so that he might take it as a mosque. The two boys said, \"No, but we will give it as a gift, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then built a mosque there. The Prophet (ﷺ) himself started carrying unburnt bricks for its building and while doing so, he was saying \"This load is better than the load of Khaibar, for it is more pious in the Sight of Allah and purer and better rewardable.\" He was also saying, \"O Allah!

When I came back to Moses he said the same, I went back to Allah and \nHe ordered me to observe ten prayers a day. When I came back to Moses, he repeated the same \nadvice, so I went back to Allah and was ordered to observe five prayers a day. \nWhen I came back to Moses, he said, 'What have you been ordered?' I replied, 'I have been ordered to \nobserve five prayers a day.' He said, 'Your followers cannot bear five prayers a day, and no doubt, I \nhave got an experience of the people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel, so go \nback to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your follower's burden.'

When the Muslims were put to test (i.e. troubled by the pagans), Abu Bakr set out migrating to the land of Ethiopia, and when he reached Bark-al-Ghimad, Ibn Ad-Daghina, the chief of the tribe of Qara, met him and said, \"O Abu Bakr! Where are you going?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"My people have turned me out (of my country), so I want to wander on the earth and worship my Lord.\" Ibn Ad-Daghina said, \"O Abu Bakr! A man like you should not leave his home-land, nor should he be driven out, because you help the destitute, earn their livings, and you keep good relations with your Kith and kin, help the weak and poor, entertain guests generously, and help the calamity-stricken persons. Therefore I am your protector. Go back and worship your Lord in your town.\"So Abu Bakr returned and Ibn Ad-Daghina accompanied him. In the evening Ibn Ad-Daghina visited the nobles of Quraish and said to them. \"A man like Abu Bakr should not leave his homeland, nor should he be driven out. Do you (i.e. Quraish) drive out a man who helps the destitute, earns their living, keeps good relations with his Kith and kin, helps the weak and poor, entertains guests generously and helps the calamity-stricken persons?\" So the people of Quraish could not refuse Ibn Ad-Daghina's protection, and they said to Ibn Ad-Daghina, \"Let Abu Bakr worship his Lord in his house. He can pray and recite there whatever he likes, but he should not hurt us with it, and should not do it publicly, because we are afraid that he may affect our women and children.\" Ibn Ad-Daghina told Abu Bakr of all that. Abu Bakr stayed in that state, worshipping his Lord in his house. He did not pray publicly, nor did he recite Quran outside his house.Then a thought occurred to Abu Bakr to build a mosque in front of his house, and there he used to pray and recite the Quran. The women and children of the pagans began to gather around him in great number. They used to wonder at him and look at him. Abu Bakr was a man who used to weep too much, and he could not help weeping on reciting the Quran. That situation scared the nobles of the pagans of Quraish, so they sent for Ibn Ad-Daghina. When he came to them, they said, \"We accepted your protection of Abu Bakr on condition that he should worship his Lord in his house, but he has violated the conditions and he has built a mosque in front of his house where he prays and recites the Quran publicly. We are now afraid that he may affect our women and children unfavorably. So, prevent him from that. If he likes to confine the worship of his Lord to his house, he may do so, but if he insists on doing that openly, ask him to release you from your obligation to protect him, for we dislike to break our pact with you, but we deny Abu Bakr the right to announce his act publicly.\" Ibn Ad-Daghina went to Abu- Bakr and said, (\"O Abu Bakr!) You know well what contract I have made on your behalf; now, you are either to abide by it, or else release me from my obligation of protecting you, because I do not want the 'Arabs hear that my people have dishonored a contract I have made on behalf of another man.\" Abu Bakr replied, \"I release you from your pact to protect me, and am pleased with the protection from Allah.\"At that time the Prophet (ﷺ) was in Mecca, and he said to the Muslims, \"In a dream I have been shown your migration place, a land of date palm trees, between two mountains, the two stony tracts.\" So, some people migrated to Medina, and most of those people who had previously migrated to the land of Ethiopia, returned to Medina. Abu Bakr also prepared to leave for Medina, but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him, \"Wait for a while, because I hope that I will be allowed to migrate also.\" Abu Bakr said, \"Do you indeed expect this? Let my father be sacrificed for you!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Yes.\" So Abu Bakr did not migrate for the sake of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in order to accompany him. He fed two she-camels he possessed with the leaves of As-Samur tree that fell on being struck by a stick for four months.One day, while we were sitting in Abu Bakr's house at noon, someone said to Abu Bakr, \"This is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) with his head covered coming at a time at which he never used to visit us before.\" Abu Bakr said, \"May my parents be sacrificed for him. By Allah, he has not come at this hour except for a great necessity.\" So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came and asked permission to enter, and he was allowed to enter. When he entered, he said to Abu Bakr. \"Tell everyone who is present with you to go away.\" Abu Bakr replied, \"There are none but your family. May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"i have been given permission to migrate.\" Abu Bakr said, \"Shall I accompany you? May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Yes.\" Abu Bakr said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! May my father be sacrificed for you, take one of these two she-camels of mine.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, \"(I will accept it) with payment.\" So we prepared the baggage quickly and put some journey food in a leather bag for them. Asma, Abu Bakr's daughter, cut a piece from her waist belt and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it, and for that reason she was named Dhat-un-Nitaqain (i.e. the owner of two belts).Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr reached a cave on the mountain of Thaur and stayed there for three nights. 'Abdullah bin Abi Bakr who was intelligent and a sagacious youth, used to stay (with them) aver night. He used to leave them before day break so that in the morning he would be with Quraish as if he had spent the night in Mecca. He would keep in mind any plot made against them, and when it became dark he would (go and) inform them of it. 'Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr, used to bring the milch sheep (of his master, Abu Bakr) to them a little while after nightfall in order to rest the sheep there. So they always had fresh milk at night, the milk of their sheep, and the milk which they warmed by throwing heated stones in it. 'Amir bin Fuhaira would then call the herd away when it was still dark (before daybreak). He did the same in each of those three nights. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr had hired a man from the tribe of Bani Ad-Dail from the family of Bani Abd bin Adi as an expert guide, and he was in alliance with the family of Al-'As bin Wail As-Sahmi and he was on the religion of the infidels of Quraish. The Prophet (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr trusted him and gave him their two she-camels and took his promise to bring their two she camels to the cave of the mountain of Thaur in the morning after three nights later. And (when they set out), 'Amir bin Fuhaira and the guide went along with them and the guide led them along the sea-shore.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 3905, Book 63, Hadith 130","grade":"","question #":"question #2","question":"How did the early Muslims, including Abu Bakr, demonstrate their commitment to their faith despite facing persecution?","id":"bukhari-63-302"},{"hadith-eng":"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) met Az-Zubair in a caravan of Muslim merchants who were returning from Sham. Az-Zubair provided Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr with white clothes to wear. When the Muslims of Medina heard the news of the departure of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) from Mecca (towards Medina), they started going to the Harra every morning . They would wait for him till the heat of the noon forced them to return. One day, after waiting for a long while, they returned home, and when they went into their houses, a Jew climbed up the roof of one of the forts of his people to look for some thing, and he saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his companions dressed in white clothes, emerging out of the desert mirage.The Jew could not help shouting at the top of his voice, \"O you 'Arabs! Here is your great man whom you have been waiting for!\" So all the Muslims rushed to their arms and received Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on the summit of Harra. The Prophet (ﷺ) turned with them to the right and alighted at the quarters of Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf, and this was on Monday in the month of Rabi-ul-Awal. Abu Bakr stood up, receiving the people while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sat down and kept silent. Some of the Ansar who came and had not seen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) before, began greeting Abu Bakr, but when the sunshine fell on Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr came forward and shaded him with his sheet only then the people came to know Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stayed with Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf for ten nights and established the mosque (mosque of Quba) which was founded on piety. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) prayed in it and then mounted his she-camel and proceeded on, accompanied by the people till his she-camel knelt down at (the place of) the Mosque of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at Medina. Some Muslims used to pray there in those days, and that place was a yard for drying dates belonging to Suhail and Sahl, the orphan boys who were under the guardianship of 'Asad bin Zurara. When his she-camel knelt down, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"This place, Allah willing, will be our abiding place.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then called the two boys and told them to suggest a price for that yard so that he might take it as a mosque. The two boys said, \"No, but we will give it as a gift, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then built a mosque there. The Prophet (ﷺ) himself started carrying unburnt bricks for its building and while doing so, he was saying \"This load is better than the load of Khaibar, for it is more pious in the Sight of Allah and purer and better rewardable.\" He was also saying, \"O Allah! The actual reward is the reward in the Hereafter, so bestow Your Mercy on the Ansar and the Emigrants.\" Thus the Prophet (ﷺ) recited (by way of proverb) the poem of some Muslim poet whose name is unknown to me.(Ibn Shibab said, \"In the Hadiths it does not occur that Allah's Apostlerecited a complete poetic verse other than this one.\")","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 3906, Book 63, Hadith 131","grade":"","question #":"question #2","question":"How did the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) and his companions respond to the threats and challenges during their migration?","id":"bukhari-63-303"},{"hadith-eng":"I prepared the journey food for the Prophet (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr when they wanted (to migrate to) Medina.

When the Muslims were put to test (i.e. troubled by the pagans), Abu Bakr set out migrating to the land of Ethiopia, and when he reached Bark-al-Ghimad, Ibn Ad-Daghina, the chief of the tribe of Qara, met him and said, \"O Abu Bakr! Where are you going?\" Abu Bakr replied, \"My people have turned me out (of my country), so I want to wander on the earth and worship my Lord.\" Ibn Ad-Daghina said, \"O Abu Bakr! A man like you should not leave his home-land, nor should he be driven out, because you help the destitute, earn their livings, and you keep good relations with your Kith and kin, help the weak and poor, entertain guests generously, and help the calamity-stricken persons. Therefore I am your protector. Go back and worship your Lord in your town.\"So Abu Bakr returned and Ibn Ad-Daghina accompanied him. In the evening Ibn Ad-Daghina visited the nobles of Quraish and said to them. \"A man like Abu Bakr should not leave his homeland, nor should he be driven out. Do you (i.e. Quraish) drive out a man who helps the destitute, earns their living, keeps good relations with his Kith and kin, helps the weak and poor, entertains guests generously and helps the calamity-stricken persons?\" So the people of Quraish could not refuse Ibn Ad-Daghina's protection, and they said to Ibn Ad-Daghina, \"Let Abu Bakr worship his Lord in his house. He can pray and recite there whatever he likes, but he should not hurt us with it, and should not do it publicly, because we are afraid that he may affect our women and children.\" Ibn Ad-Daghina told Abu Bakr of all that. Abu Bakr stayed in that state, worshipping his Lord in his house. He did not pray publicly, nor did he recite Quran outside his house.Then a thought occurred to Abu Bakr to build a mosque in front of his house, and there he used to pray and recite the Quran. The women and children of the pagans began to gather around him in great number. They used to wonder at him and look at him. Abu Bakr was a man who used to weep too much, and he could not help weeping on reciting the Quran. That situation scared the nobles of the pagans of Quraish, so they sent for Ibn Ad-Daghina. When he came to them, they said, \"We accepted your protection of Abu Bakr on condition that he should worship his Lord in his house, but he has violated the conditions and he has built a mosque in front of his house where he prays and recites the Quran publicly. We are now afraid that he may affect our women and children unfavorably. So, prevent him from that. If he likes to confine the worship of his Lord to his house, he may do so, but if he insists on doing that openly, ask him to release you from your obligation to protect him, for we dislike to break our pact with you, but we deny Abu Bakr the right to announce his act publicly.\" Ibn Ad-Daghina went to Abu- Bakr and said, (\"O Abu Bakr!) You know well what contract I have made on your behalf; now, you are either to abide by it, or else release me from my obligation of protecting you, because I do not want the 'Arabs hear that my people have dishonored a contract I have made on behalf of another man.\" Abu Bakr replied, \"I release you from your pact to protect me, and am pleased with the protection from Allah.\"At that time the Prophet (ﷺ) was in Mecca, and he said to the Muslims, \"In a dream I have been shown your migration place, a land of date palm trees, between two mountains, the two stony tracts.\" So, some people migrated to Medina, and most of those people who had previously migrated to the land of Ethiopia, returned to Medina. Abu Bakr also prepared to leave for Medina, but Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said to him, \"Wait for a while, because I hope that I will be allowed to migrate also.\" Abu Bakr said, \"Do you indeed expect this? Let my father be sacrificed for you!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Yes.\" So Abu Bakr did not migrate for the sake of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in order to accompany him. He fed two she-camels he possessed with the leaves of As-Samur tree that fell on being struck by a stick for four months.One day, while we were sitting in Abu Bakr's house at noon, someone said to Abu Bakr, \"This is Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) with his head covered coming at a time at which he never used to visit us before.\" Abu Bakr said, \"May my parents be sacrificed for him. By Allah, he has not come at this hour except for a great necessity.\" So Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) came and asked permission to enter, and he was allowed to enter. When he entered, he said to Abu Bakr. \"Tell everyone who is present with you to go away.\" Abu Bakr replied, \"There are none but your family. May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"i have been given permission to migrate.\" Abu Bakr said, \"Shall I accompany you? May my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)!\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"Yes.\" Abu Bakr said, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! May my father be sacrificed for you, take one of these two she-camels of mine.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) replied, \"(I will accept it) with payment.\" So we prepared the baggage quickly and put some journey food in a leather bag for them. Asma, Abu Bakr's daughter, cut a piece from her waist belt and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it, and for that reason she was named Dhat-un-Nitaqain (i.e. the owner of two belts).Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr reached a cave on the mountain of Thaur and stayed there for three nights. 'Abdullah bin Abi Bakr who was intelligent and a sagacious youth, used to stay (with them) aver night. He used to leave them before day break so that in the morning he would be with Quraish as if he had spent the night in Mecca. He would keep in mind any plot made against them, and when it became dark he would (go and) inform them of it. 'Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr, used to bring the milch sheep (of his master, Abu Bakr) to them a little while after nightfall in order to rest the sheep there. So they always had fresh milk at night, the milk of their sheep, and the milk which they warmed by throwing heated stones in it. 'Amir bin Fuhaira would then call the herd away when it was still dark (before daybreak). He did the same in each of those three nights. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr had hired a man from the tribe of Bani Ad-Dail from the family of Bani Abd bin Adi as an expert guide, and he was in alliance with the family of Al-'As bin Wail As-Sahmi and he was on the religion of the infidels of Quraish. The Prophet (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr trusted him and gave him their two she-camels and took his promise to bring their two she camels to the cave of the mountain of Thaur in the morning after three nights later. And (when they set out), 'Amir bin Fuhaira and the guide went along with them and the guide led them along the sea-shore.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 3905, Book 63, Hadith 130","grade":"","question #":"question #3","question":"What role did trust and alliances play in the migration of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr to Medina?","id":"bukhari-63-474"},{"hadith-eng":"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) met Az-Zubair in a caravan of Muslim merchants who were returning from Sham. Az-Zubair provided Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr with white clothes to wear. When the Muslims of Medina heard the news of the departure of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) from Mecca (towards Medina), they started going to the Harra every morning . They would wait for him till the heat of the noon forced them to return. One day, after waiting for a long while, they returned home, and when they went into their houses, a Jew climbed up the roof of one of the forts of his people to look for some thing, and he saw Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and his companions dressed in white clothes, emerging out of the desert mirage.The Jew could not help shouting at the top of his voice, \"O you 'Arabs! Here is your great man whom you have been waiting for!\" So all the Muslims rushed to their arms and received Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on the summit of Harra. The Prophet (ﷺ) turned with them to the right and alighted at the quarters of Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf, and this was on Monday in the month of Rabi-ul-Awal. Abu Bakr stood up, receiving the people while Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) sat down and kept silent. Some of the Ansar who came and had not seen Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) before, began greeting Abu Bakr, but when the sunshine fell on Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and Abu Bakr came forward and shaded him with his sheet only then the people came to know Allah's Messenger (ﷺ). Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) stayed with Bani 'Amr bin 'Auf for ten nights and established the mosque (mosque of Quba) which was founded on piety. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) prayed in it and then mounted his she-camel and proceeded on, accompanied by the people till his she-camel knelt down at (the place of) the Mosque of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) at Medina. Some Muslims used to pray there in those days, and that place was a yard for drying dates belonging to Suhail and Sahl, the orphan boys who were under the guardianship of 'Asad bin Zurara. When his she-camel knelt down, Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, \"This place, Allah willing, will be our abiding place.\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) then called the two boys and told them to suggest a price for that yard so that he might take it as a mosque.
