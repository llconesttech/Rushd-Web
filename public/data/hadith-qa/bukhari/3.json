Moses said, \"These people gave us a \nfree lift but you have broken their boat and scuttled it so as to drown its people.\" Al-Khadir replied, \n\"Didn't I tell you that you will not be able to remain patient with me.\" Moses said, \"Call me not to \naccount for what I forgot.\" The first (excuse) of Moses was that he had forgotten. \nThen they proceeded further and found a boy playing with other boys.

He was asked, \"Who \nis the most learned man amongst the people. He said, \"I am the most learned.\" Allah admonished \nMoses as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So Allah inspired to him \"At the \njunction of the two seas there is a slave amongst my slaves who is more learned than you.\" Moses \nsaid, \"O my Lord! How can I meet him?\" Allah said: Take a fish in a large basket (and proceed) and \nyou will find him at the place where you will lose the fish. So Moses set out along with his (servant) \nboy, Yusha` bin Noon and carried a fish in a large basket till they reached a rock, where they laid their \nheads (i.e. lay down) and slept. The fish came out of the basket and it took its way into the sea as in a \ntunnel. So it was an amazing thing for both Moses and his (servant) boy. They proceeded for the rest \nof that night and the following day. When the day broke, Moses said to his (servant) boy: \"Bring us \nour early meal. No doubt, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey.\" Moses did not get tired till \nhe passed the place about which he was told. There the (servant) boy told Moses, \"Do you remember \nwhen we betook ourselves to the rock, I indeed forgot the fish.\" Moses remarked, \"That is what we \nhave been seeking. So they went back retracing their footsteps, till they reached the rock. There they \nsaw a man covered with a garment (or covering himself with his own garment). Moses greeted him. \nAl-Khadir replied saying, \"How do people greet each other in your land?\" \nMoses said, \"I am Moses.\" He asked, \"The Moses of Bani Israel?\" Moses replied in the affirmative \nand added, \"May I follow you so that you teach me of that knowledge which you have been taught.\" \nAl-Khadir replied, \"Verily! You will not be able to remain patient with me, O Moses! I have some of \nthe knowledge of Allah which He has taught me and which you do not know, while you have some \nknowledge which Allah has taught you which I do not know.\" Moses said, \"Allah willing, you will \nfind me patient and I will disobey no order of yours. So both of them set out walking along the \nseashore, as they did not have a boat. In the meantime a boat passed by them and they requested the \ncrew of the boat to take them on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and took them on board \nwithout fare. Then a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or twice \nin the sea. Al-Khadir said: \"O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge have not decreased Allah's \nknowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the water of the sea with its beak.\" Al- \nKhadir went to one of the planks of the boat and plucked it out. Moses said, \"These people gave us a \nfree lift but you have broken their boat and scuttled it so as to drown its people.\" Al-Khadir replied, \n\"Didn't I tell you that you will not be able to remain patient with me.\" Moses said, \"Call me not to \naccount for what I forgot.\" The first (excuse) of Moses was that he had forgotten. \nThen they proceeded further and found a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of the \nboy's head from the top and plucked it out with his hands (i.e. killed him). Moses said, \"Have you \nkilled an innocent soul who has killed none.\" Al-Khadir replied, \"Did I not tell you that you cannot \nremain patient with me?\" Then they both proceeded till when they came to the people of a town, they \nasked them for food, but they refused to entertain them. Then they found there a wall on the point of \ncollapsing. Al-Khadir repaired it with his own hands. Moses said, \"If you had wished, surely you \ncould have taken wages for it.\" Al-Khadir replied, \"This is the parting between you and me.\" The \nProphet added, \"May Allah be Merciful to Moses!
