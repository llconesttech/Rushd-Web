Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing \nor decreasing. You replied that they were increasing. In fact, this is the result of true faith till it is \ncomplete (in all respects). \nI asked you whether there was anybody who, after embracing his religion, became displeased and \ndiscarded his religion; your reply was in the negative. In fact, this is the sign of true faith, for when its \ncheerfulness enters and mixes in the hearts completely, nobody will be displeased with it. I asked you \nwhether he had ever broken his promise. You replied in the negative. And such are the apostles; they \nnever break their promises. When I asked you whether you fought with him and he fought with you, \nyou replied that he did, and that sometimes he was victorious and sometimes you. Indeed, such are the \napostles; they are put to trials and the final victory is always theirs. \nThen I asked you what he ordered you.

He asked, 'What degree of relationship do you have \nwith him?' I replied, 'He is my cousin,' and there was none of Bani Abu Manaf in the caravan except \nmyself. Caesar said, 'Let him come nearer.' He then ordered that my companions stand behind me near \nmy shoulder and said to his translator, 'Tell his companions that I am going to ask this man about the \nman who claims to be a prophet. If he tells a lie, they should contradict him immediately.\" Abu \nSufyan added, \"By Allah! Had it not been shameful that my companions label me a liar, I would not \nhave spoken the truth about him when he asked me. But I considered it shameful to be called a liar by \nmy companions. So I told the truth. \nHe then said to his translator, 'Ask him what kind of family does he belong to.' I replied, 'He belongs \nto a noble family amongst us.' He said, 'Have anybody else amongst you ever claimed the same before \nhim? 'I replied, 'No.' He said, 'Had you ever blamed him for telling lies before he claimed what he \nclaimed? ' I replied, 'No.' He said, 'Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?' I replied, 'No.' He \nsaid, \"Do the noble or the poor follow him?' I replied, 'It is the poor who follow him.' He said, 'Are \nthey increasing or decreasing (day by day)?' I replied,' They are increasing.' He said, 'Does anybody \namongst those who embrace his (the Prophet's) Religion become displeased and then discard his \nReligion?'. I replied, 'No. ' He said, 'Does he break his promises? I replied, 'No, but we are now at \ntruce with him and we are afraid that he may betray us.\" Abu Sufyan added, \"Other than the last \nsentence, I could not say anything against him. Caesar then asked, 'Have you ever had a war with \nhim?' I replied, 'Yes.' He said, 'What was the outcome of your battles with him?' I replied, 'The result \nwas unstable; sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.' He said, 'What does he order you to \ndo?' I said, 'He tells us to worship Allah alone, and not to worship others along with Him, and to leave \nall that our fore-fathers used to worship. He orders us to pray, give in charity, be chaste, keep \npromises and return what is entrusted to us.' \nWhen I had said that, Caesar said to his translator, 'Say to him: I ask you about his lineage and your \nreply was that he belonged to a noble family. In fact, all the apostles came from the noblest lineage of \ntheir nations. Then I questioned you whether anybody else amongst you had claimed such a thing, and \nyour reply was in the negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that \nthis man was following a claim that had been said before him. When I asked you whether he was ever \nblamed for telling lies, your reply was in the negative, so I took it for granted that a person who did \nnot tell a lie about (others) the people could never tell a lie about Allah. Then I asked you whether any \nof his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I \nwould have thought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom. When I asked you \nwhether the rich or the poor people followed him, you replied that it was the poor who followed him. \nIn fact, such are the followers of the apostles. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing \nor decreasing. You replied that they were increasing. In fact, this is the result of true faith till it is \ncomplete (in all respects). \nI asked you whether there was anybody who, after embracing his religion, became displeased and \ndiscarded his religion; your reply was in the negative. In fact, this is the sign of true faith, for when its \ncheerfulness enters and mixes in the hearts completely, nobody will be displeased with it. I asked you \nwhether he had ever broken his promise. You replied in the negative. And such are the apostles; they \nnever break their promises. When I asked you whether you fought with him and he fought with you, \nyou replied that he did, and that sometimes he was victorious and sometimes you. Indeed, such are the \napostles; they are put to trials and the final victory is always theirs. \nThen I asked you what he ordered you. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah alone and \nnot to worship others along with Him, to leave all that your fore-fathers used to worship, to offer \nprayers, to speak the truth, to be chaste, to keep promises, and to return what is entrusted to you. \nThese are really the qualities of a prophet who, I knew (from the previous Scriptures) would appear, \nbut I did not know that he would be from amongst you. If what you say should be true, he will very \nsoon occupy the earth under my feet, and if I knew that I would reach him definitely, I would go \nimmediately to meet Him; and were I with him, then I would certainly wash his feet.' \" Abu Sufyan \nadded, \"Caesar then asked for the letter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and it was read. Its contents were: \n\"In the name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful (This letter is) from Muhammad, the \nslave of Allah, and His Apostle, to Heraculius, the Ruler of the Byzantine. Peace be upon the \nfollowers of guidance. Now then, I invite you to Islam (i.e. surrender to Allah), embrace Islam and \nyou will be safe; embrace Islam and Allah will bestow on you a double reward. But if you reject this \ninvitation of Islam, you shall be responsible for misguiding the tillers (i.e. your nation). O people of \nthe Scriptures!

Then if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are (they who have surrendered (unto \nHim)..(3.64) \nAbu Sufyan added, \"When Heraclius had finished his speech, there was a great hue and cry caused by \nthe Byzantine Royalties surrounding him, and there was so much noise that I did not understand what \nthey said. So, we were turned out of the court. When I went out with my companions and we were \nalone, I said to them, 'Verily, Ibn Abi Kabsha's (i.e. the Prophet's) affair has gained power.

They proceeded till they reached Hadaa, a place \nbetween 'Usfan, and Mecca, and their news reached a branch of the tribe of Hudhail called Bani \nLihyan. About two-hundred men, who were all archers, hurried to follow their tracks till they found \nthe place where they had eaten dates they had brought with them from Medina. They said, \"These are \nthe dates of Yathrib (i.e. Medina), \"and continued following their tracks When `Asim and his \ncompanions saw their pursuers, they went up a high place and the infidels circled them.

I will not come down to be \nunder the protection of infidels. O Allah! Convey our news to Your Prophet. Then the infidels threw \narrows at them till they martyred `Asim along with six other men, and three men came down \naccepting their promise and convention, and they were Khubaib-al-Ansari and Ibn Dathina and \nanother man So, when the infidels captured them, they undid the strings of their bows and tied them. \nThen the third (of the captives) said, \"This is the first betrayal. By Allah! I will not go with you. No \ndoubt these, namely the martyred, have set a good example to us.\" So, they dragged him and tried to \ncompel him to accompany them, but as he refused, they killed him. They took Khubaid and Ibn \nDathina with them and sold them (as slaves) in Mecca (and all that took place) after the battle of Badr. \nKhubaib was bought by the sons of Al-Harith bin 'Amir bin Naufal bin `Abd Manaf. It was Khubaib \nwho had killed Al-Harith bin 'Amir on the day (of the battle of) Badr. So, Khubaib remained a \nprisoner with those people. \nNarrated Az-Zuhri: 'Ubaidullah bin 'Iyyad said that the daughter of Al-Harith had told him, \"When \nthose people gathered (to kill Khubaib) he borrowed a razor from me to shave his pubes and I gave it \nto him. Then he took a son of mine while I was unaware when he came upon him. I saw him placing \nmy son on his thigh and the razor was in his hand. I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed the \nagitation on my face and said, 'Are you afraid that I will kill him? No, I will never do so.' By Allah, I \nnever saw a prisoner better than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating of a bunch of grapes in \nhis hand while he was chained in irons, and there was no fruit at that time in Mecca.\" The daughter of \nAl-Harith used to say, \"It was a boon Allah bestowed upon Khubaib.\" When they took him out of the \nSanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him outside its boundaries, Khubaib requested them to let him offer two \nrak`at (prayer). \nThey allowed him and he offered Two rak`at and then said, \"Hadn't I been afraid that you would think \nthat I was afraid (of being killed), I would have prolonged the prayer. O Allah, kill them all with no \nexception.\" (He then recited the poetic verse):-- \"I being martyred as a Muslim, Do not mind how I am \nkilled in Allah's Cause, For my killing is for Allah's Sake, And if Allah wishes, He will bless the \namputated parts of a torn body\" Then the son of Al Harith killed him. So, it was Khubaib who set the \ntradition for any Muslim sentenced to death in captivity, to offer a two-rak`at prayer (before being \nkilled). Allah fulfilled the invocation of `Asim bin Thabit on that very day on which he was martyred. \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) informed his companions of their news and what had happened to them. Later on when \nsome infidels from Quraish were informed that `Asim had been killed, they sent some people to fetch \na part of his body (i.e. his head) by which he would be recognized. (That was because) `Asim had \nkilled one of their chiefs on the day (of the battle) of Badr. So, a swarm of wasps, resembling a shady \ncloud, were sent to hover over `Asim and protect him from their messenger and thus they could not \ncut off anything from his flesh.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 3045, Book 56, Hadith 251","grade":"","question #":"question #2","question":"How did Khubaib ibn Adi demonstrate his faith and character during his captivity?","id":"bukhari-56-557"},{"hadith-eng":"The Prophet (ﷺ) said, \"Free the captives, feed the hungry and pay a visit to the sick.\"","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 3046, Book 56, Hadith 252","grade":"","question #":"question #2","question":"How does Islam emphasize the importance of feeding the hungry?","id":"bukhari-56-558"},{"hadith-eng":"I asked `Ali, \"Do you have the knowledge of any Divine Inspiration besides what is in Allah's Book?\" \n`Ali replied, \"No, by Him Who splits the grain of corn and creates the soul.

I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed the \nagitation on my face and said, 'Are you afraid that I will kill him? No, I will never do so.' By Allah, I \nnever saw a prisoner better than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating of a bunch of grapes in \nhis hand while he was chained in irons, and there was no fruit at that time in Mecca.\" The daughter of \nAl-Harith used to say, \"It was a boon Allah bestowed upon Khubaib.\" When they took him out of the \nSanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him outside its boundaries, Khubaib requested them to let him offer two \nrak`at (prayer). \nThey allowed him and he offered Two rak`at and then said, \"Hadn't I been afraid that you would think \nthat I was afraid (of being killed), I would have prolonged the prayer. O Allah, kill them all with no \nexception.\" (He then recited the poetic verse):-- \"I being martyred as a Muslim, Do not mind how I am \nkilled in Allah's Cause, For my killing is for Allah's Sake, And if Allah wishes, He will bless the \namputated parts of a torn body\" Then the son of Al Harith killed him.

Allah fulfilled the invocation of `Asim bin Thabit on that very day on which he was martyred. \nThe Prophet (ﷺ) informed his companions of their news and what had happened to them. Later on when \nsome infidels from Quraish were informed that `Asim had been killed, they sent some people to fetch \na part of his body (i.e. his head) by which he would be recognized. (That was because) `Asim had \nkilled one of their chiefs on the day (of the battle) of Badr.
