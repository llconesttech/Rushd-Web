I was collecting for my she-camels equipment of saddles, sacks and ropes while my two shecamels \nwere kneeling down beside the room of an Ansari man. I returned after collecting whatever I \ncollected, to see the humps of my two she-camels cut off and their flanks cut open and some portion \nof their livers was taken out. When I saw that state of my two she-camels, I could not help weeping. I \nasked, \"Who has done this?\" The people replied, \"Hamza bin `Abdul Muttalib who is staying with \nsome Ansari drunks in this house.\" I went away till I reached the Prophet (ﷺ) and Zaid bin Haritha was \nwith him. The Prophet (ﷺ) noticed on my face the effect of what I had suffered, so the Prophet (ﷺ) asked. \n\"What is wrong with you.\" I replied, \"O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I have never seen such a day as today. \nHamza attacked my two she-camels, cut off their humps, and ripped open their flanks, and he is sitting \nthere in a house in the company of some drunks.\" The Prophet (ﷺ) then asked for his covering sheet, put it \non, and set out walking followed by me and Zaid bin Haritha till he came to the house where Hamza \nwas. He asked permission to enter, and they allowed him, and they were drunk. Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) started \nrebuking Hamza for what he had done, but Hamza was drunk and his eyes were red. Hamza looked at \nAllah's Messenger (ﷺ) and then he raised his eyes, looking at his knees, then he raised up his eyes looking at \nhis umbilicus, and again he raised up his eyes look in at his face. Hamza then said, \"Aren't you but the \nslaves of my father?\" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) realized that he was drunk, so Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) retreated, and we \nwent out with him.","reference":"Sahih al-Bukhari 3091, Book 57, Hadith 1","grade":"","question #":"question #1","question":"What are the consequences of alcohol consumption as depicted in the actions of Hamza in this narration?","id":"bukhari-57-1"},{"hadith-eng":"(mother of the believers) After the death of Allah 's Apostle Fatima the daughter of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) \nasked Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to give her, her share of inheritance from what Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) had left of \nthe Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting) which Allah had given him.

Az-Zubair had four wives, and after the one-third of his property \nwas excluded (according to the will), each of his wives received one million and two hundred \nthousand.
